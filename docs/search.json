    "text": "👋 Welcome!\nWelcome to STAT 545 at the University of British Columbia! Whether you’re a student enrolled in STAT 545 or simply someone looking to learn how to write reproducible and collaborative data analyses, it is our hope that this website will serve as a great resource for learning these new skills!\nIn short, this course will enable you to confidently write clean and modern data analyses in R using version control software (GitHub), and creating reports using R Markdown. The primary focus will be on using these technologies to conduct analyses with daily workflow, rather than the statistical theory and methods for analysis.\nThis course is divided into two parts. In Part I (STAT545 A), we will introduce\n\nR and RStudio,\nReport generation with R Markdown,\nProject organization, workflow, and coding style,\nData management with dataframes and tibbles using tidyverse,\nData visualization with ggplot2, and\nVersion control using Git and Github.\n\nIn Part II (STAT545 B), we will dive deeper into\n\nWriting functions in R,\nAdvanced computations on data,\nFunctional programming with purrr,\nR packages,\nInteractive pages, apps, and graphics with RShiny, and\nWebsite development using Quarto.\n\nIf you are a student enrolling in this course for credit at UBC, you MUST take STAT 545 A to enroll in STAT545 B. There are no exceptions to this rule."

    "section": "Quarto Websites",
    "text": "Quarto Websites\nTurns out, you’ve been using a Quarto website this whole semester! Our STAT545 webpage (the one you’re on right now) was build entirely using Quarto. And, this was build using no prior Quarto knowledge or fancy tools - this was actually my first website build ever.\nLet’s “learn by doing” and build a webpage together! This is a great opportunity to build a professional website (like mine) using Quarto. We will host our website on Github to make things easy!\nBefore continuing, ensure that you’ve installed Quarto using the tutorial in the previous sections.\n\nInitial Website Set-up\nStep 1: In RStudio, create a New Project. Select “New Directory” and then find “Quarto Website”. If given an option for version control, select Git. A simple build of a two paged website will generate.\nStep 2: In the Terminal, run touch .nojekyll (Mac OS) or copy NUL .nojekyll to disable Jekyll.\nStep 3: Within the RStudio project, navigate to the _quarto.yml file in your files (right hand pane). Under the project: preamble, add output-dir: docs.\nStep 4: Navigate back to index.qmd. Save and click the Render button. A local version of this simple website will appear.\nNow, we should send this to GitHub so we can host our website on GitHub and make changes both locally and through GitHub. To do so, we need to connect this R Project with Github.\nStep 5: When you made this project, you should have selected to use Git as a version control. If not, head to Tools &gt; Version control &gt; Project Setup and select Git as your version control. At this time, origin should be set to none.\nStep 6: On GitHub, make a new EMPTY repository. This should be named with the same name as your website (i.e., yourname.github.io). Ensure you UNSELECT to make a README file.\nStep 7: Now back to RStudio. We will be working in the terminal to give commands to our computer to connect with Github.\n\nSAVE ALL FILES. In the Terminal (beside the Console in RStudio)\nRun git init\nRun git add .\nThen, commit the changes of our website to Git. Type git commit -m \"initial commit\"\n\nThe -m \"&lt;description&gt;\" part adds the &lt;description&gt; of your changes.\n\nNow we need to tell GitHub where we are pushing our changes to (i.e., the repository you just created!) using git remote add origin https://github.com/&lt;yourusername&gt;/&lt;yourreponame&gt; and filling in your username and repository name.\nPush the changes using git push -u origin main. Head back to github to see new files added to your repository.\n\nStep 8: See your new website\n\nOn Github in your repository, click the three dots and head to settings.\nNavigate to pages on the lefthand side menu.\nUnder branch, select main as your branch and /docs as the folder. Select save.\nGive it a few minutes and refresh if you don’t see a success message pointing to the website.\nHead to &lt;yourreponame&gt;.github.io to see if it worked!\n\nStep 9: Edit your website and push the changes\n\nEdit your version locally, and render and save.\nThen, in the terminal:\n\nRun git add .\nRun git commit -m \"&lt;description of your changes&gt;\"\nRun git push origin main\n\n\n\n\nGeneral tips\n\nSometime if you change a file name or remove it, Quarto will get confused. You can go to the docs folder and delete the old file name/file you deleted and re-render and save.\nTo re-render all documents, use quarto render in the Terminal. Then, save all. Do this before staging and committing changes to GitHub.\nUse folders to keep things organized.\nFor people less familiar with Markdown syntax, the “Visual” viewer is useful! It provides a more user-friendly IDE and buttons for things like titles, bold text, lists, links, images, formatting, and tables. It is directly below the Save button on RStudio. You can toggle between Source and Visual to see the Markdown version and a more visual version of your files."

    "section": "Create a Professional Website",
    "text": "Create a Professional Website\nLet’s build on this sample Quarto website to make something more personal and professional.\n\nBuild the Template\nOpen the _quarto.yml file. Let’s update the contents to this (fill in &lt;Your Name&gt;):\nproject:\n  type: website\n  output-dir: docs\n\nwebsite:\n  title: \"&lt;Your Name&gt;\"\n  navbar:\n    left:\n      - href: index.qmd\n        text: Home\n\nformat:\n  html:\n    theme:\n      - cosmo\n      - brand\n    css: styles.css\n\n\nUpdate the Homepage\nThe homepage is our index.qmd file. In our _quarto.yml document, we named this page “Home”! You can see this in this section:\n      - href: index.qmd\n        text: Home\nNow that we’ve told Quarto where our homepage is, let’s update it.\n\n\nAdd a Headshot and Link your GitHub\nIt’s useful to add a headshot to your website! At this point if you don’t have a nice photo of yourself or are not comfortable adding one, just grab a stock image online of your favourite animal. (Side note: I’d recommend getting a professional headshot if you don’t have one! This is something on my own personal to-do list)\n\nCreate an images folder in your directory (same place as your index.qmd file), and save the image you’d like to display there. I’d recommend saving the image as avatar.png.\n\nWe will use the jolla template, which is provides a nice home page for personal websites. We’ll also add a link to your GitHub profile so people can see your projects.\nIn your files, you should see index.qmd. Do not rename this file! Quarto knows that this is your “home page”.\n\nOpen and edit the index.qmd file, and fill in the appropriate information indicated in &lt;&gt;:\n\n---\ntitle: \"&lt;Your Name&gt;\"\nabout:\n  template: jolla\n  image: images/avatar.png\n  links:\n    - icon: github\n      text: Github\n      href: https://github.com/&lt;yourgithubusername&gt;\n---\nThe stuff between the --- is called the Preamble, which builds the foundation of the webpage.\n\n\nAdd your Education\n\nLet’s add your position (Graduate Student in &lt;Department&gt;) in italics, and add our institution. This will be under our photo. Let’s add the following under our Preamble:\n\n*Graduate Student in &lt;Department&gt;*\n\nUniversity of British Columbia \nLet’s also make a subsection for a more detailed look at your education. Add your current and previous education under an Education header (feel free to add or remove lines):\n## Education\n\nDegree, School | Year\n\nDegree, School | Year\n\nDegree, School | Year\n\n\nCreate Another Page\nLet’s add another page that we can navigate to! First, let’s add a .qmd page to our directory. Click “File” &gt; “New File” &gt; “Quarto Document”. Add a title to your page, and keep all other defaults. We will be adding a page containing Courses we’ve taken at UBC as an example. An appropriate name could be simply “Courses”. We can update this later if needed.\nOpen the new file. Update the preamble to include the date at which the page was last modified:\n---\ntitle: \"Courses\"\ndate-modified: last-modified\n---\nNow, let’s add some information! It’s your turn to explore Quarto.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise: Add a Courses Page\n\n\n\n\nAdd a subsection (##) of your current courses\n\nAdd a list of courses you’re currently taking, and link them to the UBC course calendar descriptions or course website.\nHINT: try visual mode if you cannot remember how to write links or lists in Markdown\n\nAdd a subsection (##) for past courses\n\nAdd a list of some past courses you’re taken at UBC or another institution, and link them to the a course calendar descriptions or course website. Indicate what institution you took the courses at (i.e., STAT 200 (UBC))\n\n\n\n\nNow, the page is ready to add to our website. Open the _quarto.yml file and add courses.qmd to the list of webpages.\nwebsite:\n  title: \"&lt;Your Name&gt;\"\n  navbar:\n    left:\n      - href: index.qmd\n        text: Home\n      - courses.qmd\nHead back to courses.qmd, save all, and render. Do you see your new page in the navigation bar?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise: Add Another Page\n\n\n\nFollow the previous steps to add another page to your website. Here are some ideas!\n\nYour CV\nProjects (course projects (linked to your GitHub repo!), publications, conference talks, poster presentations)\nExtracurriculars\nAwards\nBlog\nMiscellaneous (hobbies)\n\nFeel free to get creative. This is just practice for website building - you can always come back and update your website later. Just remember, the website is PUBLIC. Do not put any information that you do not want shared on the internet.\n\n\nSave all files and click the Render button. Click through your website to ensure that everything is working!\n\n\nPush your Changes to Github\nEverything you’ve done so far only exists on your local machine.\nIn the terminal, do quarto render to re-render all documents. Save all.\nThen,sStage, commit, and push your changes (Steps 7 and 8 above). Test our your new website by visiting it using the GitHub link (see Step 8)."

    "title": "Lecture 14: Professional Websites with Quarto",
    "section": "Getting Fancy",
    "text": "Getting Fancy\nHere are some ways you can elevate your website!\n\nAdding a Search Bar\n\nAdd search: true under your navbar in your _quarto.yml file\nExample:\nwebsite:\n  title: \"STAT545 @ UBC\"\n  navbar:\n    background: primary\n    search: true\n\n\n\nAdding Icons to Navigation Bar\nSometimes, we want to use an icon instead of a work. For example, I could change “Home” to a house icon using:\nwebsite:\n  title: \"STAT545 @ UBC\"\n  navbar:\n    background: primary\n    search: true\n    left:\n      - href: index.qmd\n        text: \" \"\n        icon: house-door-fill\nThis will remove the Home text and replace it with a home icon.\n\n\nAdding a Drop-down Menu\nSome websites (like our STAT545 website) have so many pages that we need to condense topics into our top navigation bar. This can be achieved with a drop-down menu. I’ll show an example of how I have a drop-down menu for the two STAT545 Syllabi (A and B).\nI like to organize the website so that anything in a drop-down menu is in its own folder. For example, I have a webpages folder that contains a file (or folder) for each item I want on my navigation bar. I have my two syllabi hosted in webpages/syllabus/syllabusA.qmd and webpages/syllabus/syllabusB.qmd.\nTo create a drop-down menu, we use sidebar: in the _quarto.yml document:\nwebsite:\n  title: \"STAT545 @ UBC\"\n  navbar:\n    background: primary\n    search: true\n    left:\n      - href: index.qmd\n        text: \" \"\n        icon: house-door-fill\n      - sidebar:syllabus\n-sidebar:syllabus tells Quarto that I am going to have subpages, and I reference them using the syllabus id. For example:\nwebsite:\n  title: \"STAT545 @ UBC\"\n  navbar:\n    background: primary\n    search: true\n    left:\n      - href: index.qmd\n        text: \" \"\n        icon: house-door-fill\n      - sidebar:syllabus\n        \n  sidebar:\n    - id: syllabus\n      title: \"Syllabus\"\n      style: \"docked\"\n      background: light\n      collapse-level: 2\n      contents: \n        - webpages/syllabus/syllabusA.qmd\n        - webpages/syllabus/syllabusB.qmd\nThis creates a section on my Navigation Bar called “Syllabus”, which drops down to contain syllabusA.qmd and syllabusB.qmd, which are regular pages like the courses.qmd that we created!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdd a GitHub Link on your Navigation Bar\nWe can add a right-hand link to GitHub with its own icon. This will appear beside the search icon. In the _quarto.yml, add a right: section linking to GitHub.\nwebsite:\n  title: \"STAT545 @ UBC\"\n  navbar:\n    background: primary\n    search: true\n    left:\n...\n...\n...\n        \n    right:\n      - href: \"https://github.com/UBC-STAT/STAT545.github.io\"\n        text: \"GitHub\"\n        icon: github\n\n\nAdd a Table of Contents on Each Page\nIf you have a lot of information on each page, adding a Table of Contents can be useful. In the _quarto.yml, add toc: true\nformat:\n  html:\n    theme:\n      - cosmo\n      - brand\n    css: styles.css\n    toc: true\n\n\nAdd a Favicon (Website Icon) and Logo\nFavicons are useful ways to brand your website. These are small icons that identify your website (think Facebook with their infamous blue “F”, or Google’s rainbow “F”) that appear in browser tabs such as Google Chrome and on web searches.\nIn the _quarto.yml file, we can include the following under website:\nwebsite:\n      favicon: &lt;favicon.png&gt;\nwhere &lt;favicon.png&gt; is the image (or path to the image, if its in a folder) that you’d like to use!\nYou can also add a logo that appears in the top lefthand corner of your website using the logo command, for example:\n navbar:\n    background: primary\n    search: true\n    logo: &lt;yourlogo&gt;.png\n\n\nExtras\nThere is SO much more that Quarto can do, and this is just scratching the surface. From aesthetics to website navigation, https://quarto.org/docs/websites/ has so many examples of cool things you can do with your website.\nIf you’d like to see how THIS exact website was built, check out https://github.com/UBC-STAT/STAT545.github.io."

    "text": "Working with Strings\nOur main tools for working with strings will be the powerful stringr package in the tidyverse paired with regular expressions (also called regex).\nWe’ll be going through a few examples with the enron dataset, which you can download on Github. Enron is a database of 270,087 Enron emails, taken from the May 7, 2015 version of the dataset. Data was extracted from CMU. There are three columns in enron.csv:\n\nperson: The person associated with the email.\nmail_num: Identifier for each person’s email.\nemail: Each entry is a line in an email, including the email’s metadata (like subject, who it was sent to, etc.)\n\nLet’s load in the data:\n\nenron &lt;- read_csv(\"datasets/enron.csv\")\nhead(enron)\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 3\n  mail_num person  email                                                    \n     &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;   &lt;chr&gt;                                                    \n1        1 allen-p Message-ID: &lt;18782981.1075855378110.JavaMail.evans@thyme&gt;\n2        1 allen-p Date: Mon, 14 May 2001 16:39:00 -0700 (PDT)              \n3        1 allen-p From: phillip.allen@enron.com                            \n4        1 allen-p To: tim.belden@enron.com                                 \n5        1 allen-p Subject:                                                 \n6        1 allen-p Mime-Version: 1.0                                        \n\n\nFor each email sent in this data set (mail_num), we have the sender (person) along with the lines of the email in separate entries in the data frame (email). For now, we’ll focus on the contents of the email, in the email column.\n\nenron_email &lt;- enron$email\n\n\nNon-regex String Manipulation\nWe’ll first go through some stringr functions that don’t require regular expressions.\n\nstr_detech() and str_subset()\nLet’s filter only on entries that contain emails. We can do this by calling str_detect() and finding entries that contain “From:”:\n\nenron_email_at&lt;- str_detect(enron_email, \"@\") # find all entries with \"@\" in the email column\n\nhead(enron_email_at)\n\n[1]  TRUE FALSE  TRUE  TRUE FALSE FALSE\n\n\nstr_detect actually returns a logical vector showing whether or not “@” was found in the email contents! To get the subset, we can use str_subset():\n\nenron_email_at &lt;- str_subset(enron_email, \"@\") #overwrite:\nhead(enron_email_at)\n\n[1] \"Message-ID: &lt;18782981.1075855378110.JavaMail.evans@thyme&gt;\"\n[2] \"From: phillip.allen@enron.com\"                            \n[3] \"To: tim.belden@enron.com\"                                 \n[4] \"X-To: Tim Belden &lt;Tim Belden/Enron@EnronXGate&gt;\"           \n[5] \"Message-ID: &lt;15464986.1075855378456.JavaMail.evans@thyme&gt;\"\n[6] \"From: phillip.allen@enron.com\"                            \n\n\n\n\nstr_split()\nLet’s say we wanted to count the number of times the word “important” was written in an email. To do this, we can split every email line into its individual words using the str_split() function. Let’s split by spaces to get each individual word.\n\nenron_email_words &lt;- str_split(enron_email, \" \")\n\nhead(enron_email_words)\n\n[[1]]\n[1] \"Message-ID:\"                                  \n[2] \"&lt;18782981.1075855378110.JavaMail.evans@thyme&gt;\"\n\n[[2]]\n[1] \"Date:\"    \"Mon,\"     \"14\"       \"May\"      \"2001\"     \"16:39:00\" \"-0700\"   \n[8] \"(PDT)\"   \n\n[[3]]\n[1] \"From:\"                   \"phillip.allen@enron.com\"\n\n[[4]]\n[1] \"To:\"                  \"tim.belden@enron.com\"\n\n[[5]]\n[1] \"Subject:\"\n\n[[6]]\n[1] \"Mime-Version:\" \"1.0\"          \n\n\nWe get a list! This is because we don’t know how many words each entry will contain, so a list is the most flexible option. If we really wanted a vector of all of the individual words (which, we do!), we can unlist() the list:\n\nenron_email_words &lt;- unlist(enron_email_words)\n\nhead(enron_email_words)\n\n[1] \"Message-ID:\"                                  \n[2] \"&lt;18782981.1075855378110.JavaMail.evans@thyme&gt;\"\n[3] \"Date:\"                                        \n[4] \"Mon,\"                                         \n[5] \"14\"                                           \n[6] \"May\"                                          \n\n\nNow, we can subset by which words contain “important”, and count the number of entries!\n\n\nenron_emails_important &lt;- str_subset(enron_email_words, \"important\")\nlength(enron_emails_important)\n\n[1] 91\n\n\n91 times! But unfortunately, str_subset() is case sensitive… See:\n\nenron_emails_important &lt;- str_subset(enron_email_words, \"Important\")\nlength(enron_emails_important)\n\n[1] 9\n\n\nand..\n\nenron_emails_important &lt;- str_subset(enron_email_words, \"IMPORTANT\")\nlength(enron_emails_important)\n\n[1] 5\n\n\nThis is where regular expressions come in handy! We’ll discuss this in the following section.\n\n\n\nRegular Expressions (regex)\nRegular expressions provide a powerful tool to extract character data through patterns! In regexes, specific characters and constructs take on special meaning in order to match multiple strings.\nWe will go through a few common regex special characters, but refer readers to this Cheat Sheet by Ian Kopacka for a more in-depth review.\nLet’s consider a simple vector of words:\n\n\nwords &lt;- c(\"bat\", \"cat\", \"5at\", \"rats\", \"?at\", \"kittycat\", \"doormats\", \"attic\", \"matchstick\", \"hat-trick\", \"hattrick\", \"hat trick\")\n\n\n. (match any letter)\nThe . in regex allows us to match any character (i.e., a number, letter, symbol (aside from a new line)) in an expression.\nFor example, the pattern .at would match any word that has at least three characters, where we have some character followed by “at”.\n\nstr_subset(words, pattern = \".at\")\n\n [1] \"bat\"        \"cat\"        \"5at\"        \"rats\"       \"?at\"       \n [6] \"kittycat\"   \"doormats\"   \"matchstick\" \"hat-trick\"  \"hattrick\"  \n[11] \"hat trick\" \n\n\n\n\n$, ^ (anchors)\nAnchors can be included in an expression to indicate where the expression must occur in a string. ^ indicates that the string must start with the phrase, and $ indicates the string must end with it.\n\nstr_subset(words, pattern = \"^.at\")\n\n[1] \"bat\"        \"cat\"        \"5at\"        \"rats\"       \"?at\"       \n[6] \"matchstick\" \"hat-trick\"  \"hattrick\"   \"hat trick\" \n\n\nNotice how we did not select “attic”,“kittycat” or “doormats”\n\nstr_subset(words, pattern = \".at$\")\n\n[1] \"bat\"      \"cat\"      \"5at\"      \"?at\"      \"kittycat\"\n\n\nNotice how we only selected words ending in &lt;some chatacter&gt;at.\n\n\n\\b and \\B (boundaries and not a word boundary)\n\\b indicates a word boundary, and \\B indicates NOT a word boundary. To see what we mean, see the following:\n\nstr_subset(words, pattern = \"\\\\btrick\")\n\n[1] \"hat-trick\" \"hat trick\"\n\n\nThis selected words that were separated by either a “-” or space.\n\nstr_subset(words, pattern = \"\\\\Btrick\")\n\n[1] \"hattrick\"\n\n\nThis selected words that did not have any separation between them.\n\n\n*, +, ? (quantifiers)\nWe can specify regex to match any number of characters\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuantifier\nNumber of Characters\nRange to Match\nMeaning\n\n\n\n\n*\n0 or more\n{n}\nexactly n\n\n\n+\n1 or more\n{n,}\nat least n\n\n\n?\n0 or 1\n{,m}\nat most m\n\n\n\n\n{n,m}\nbetween n and m, inclusive\n\n\n\nFor example, let’s match words that have 0 or more characters before “at”.\n\nstr_subset(words, pattern = \".*at\")\n\n [1] \"bat\"        \"cat\"        \"5at\"        \"rats\"       \"?at\"       \n [6] \"kittycat\"   \"doormats\"   \"attic\"      \"matchstick\" \"hat-trick\" \n[11] \"hattrick\"   \"hat trick\" \n\n\nAll of our words contain “at” somewhere so they are all matched. What about strictly one or more characters before “at”?\n\nstr_subset(words, pattern = \".+at\")\n\n [1] \"bat\"        \"cat\"        \"5at\"        \"rats\"       \"?at\"       \n [6] \"kittycat\"   \"doormats\"   \"matchstick\" \"hat-trick\"  \"hattrick\"  \n[11] \"hat trick\" \n\n\nAll but attic. Makes sense!\nWe can also match on specific letters. Let’s select words with one or more “o”’s in it:\n\nstr_subset(words, pattern = \"o+\")\n\n[1] \"doormats\"\n\n\nOf course, regular expressions can be combined together to make powerful search tools, as well. For more on regular expressions, check out Chapter 11 of the STAT545 Textbookand the STAT545 video lecture. We will also learn more as we work through Worksheet B2."

    "section": "Factors",
    "text": "Factors\n\n“There is no other object that creates as much trouble as factors.” - Patrick Burns, “The R Inferno”.\n\nIn R, we use factors to represent categorical variables: variables that take on a fixed number of known values (i.e. levels). For example, in the penguins data set, species is a factor with three levels: “Adelie”, “Chinstrap”, and “Gentoo”. We can see this by looking at the str() (structure) of the tibble:\n\nstr(penguins)\n\n'data.frame':   344 obs. of  8 variables:\n $ species    : Factor w/ 3 levels \"Adelie\",\"Chinstrap\",..: 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ...\n $ island     : Factor w/ 3 levels \"Biscoe\",\"Dream\",..: 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 ...\n $ bill_len   : num  39.1 39.5 40.3 NA 36.7 39.3 38.9 39.2 34.1 42 ...\n $ bill_dep   : num  18.7 17.4 18 NA 19.3 20.6 17.8 19.6 18.1 20.2 ...\n $ flipper_len: int  181 186 195 NA 193 190 181 195 193 190 ...\n $ body_mass  : int  3750 3800 3250 NA 3450 3650 3625 4675 3475 4250 ...\n $ sex        : Factor w/ 2 levels \"female\",\"male\": 2 1 1 NA 1 2 1 2 NA NA ...\n $ year       : int  2007 2007 2007 2007 2007 2007 2007 2007 2007 2007 ...\n\n\nor we can explicitly look at the class and levels of the variable of interest by:\n\nclass(penguins$species)\n\n[1] \"factor\"\n\nlevels(penguins$species)\n\n[1] \"Adelie\"    \"Chinstrap\" \"Gentoo\"   \n\n\nUnder the hood, R stores a factor with (say) 3 levels as a numeric vector containing integers between 1 and 3, paired with a character vector of length 3 that identifies the mapping between the numbers 1, 2, and 3 and the levels.\nThis is not immediately obvious, because R will print factors using the character string levels rather than the numbers that it stores:\n\nset.seed(100) #make reproducible (more on this later)\n\npenguins %&gt;% \n  slice_sample(n=10) %&gt;% #take 10 random rows\n  pull(species) #output the species only\n\n [1] Gentoo    Adelie    Gentoo    Adelie    Chinstrap Chinstrap Adelie   \n [8] Adelie    Gentoo    Chinstrap\nLevels: Adelie Chinstrap Gentoo\n\n\nThis dual nature of factors creates a whole slew of hidden traps and headaches, especially for new R users!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCaution\n\n\n\nSometimes factors are coded (i.e., written) in the data as integers. Without explicitly telling R, R will assume any numeric data are just regular old numbers.\nAlways ensure that factors are explicit in your code!\n\n\nFor example, suppose in the penguins data set than instead of their names, species had levels “1”, “2”, and “3’ where”1” could represent Gentoo, “2” Adelie, and 3 “Chinstrap” penguins. So, instead of having the names of penguin species as strings, they are coded as numeric values.\n\npenguins2 &lt;- penguins %&gt;%\n  mutate(species = recode(species, \"Gentoo\" = 1, \"Adelie\" = 2, \"Chinstrap\" = 3))\n\nstr(penguins2)\n\n'data.frame':   344 obs. of  8 variables:\n $ species    : num  2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 ...\n $ island     : Factor w/ 3 levels \"Biscoe\",\"Dream\",..: 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 ...\n $ bill_len   : num  39.1 39.5 40.3 NA 36.7 39.3 38.9 39.2 34.1 42 ...\n $ bill_dep   : num  18.7 17.4 18 NA 19.3 20.6 17.8 19.6 18.1 20.2 ...\n $ flipper_len: int  181 186 195 NA 193 190 181 195 193 190 ...\n $ body_mass  : int  3750 3800 3250 NA 3450 3650 3625 4675 3475 4250 ...\n $ sex        : Factor w/ 2 levels \"female\",\"male\": 2 1 1 NA 1 2 1 2 NA NA ...\n $ year       : int  2007 2007 2007 2007 2007 2007 2007 2007 2007 2007 ...\n\n\nWe see here that R assumes that species is a numeric variable, not a categorical variable. To ensure R knows that species is categorical, we can use:\n\npenguins2 &lt;- penguins2 %&gt;% #overwrite existing tibble\n  mutate(species = as.factor(species)) #overwrite species to be a factor using as.factor\n\nstr(penguins2)\n\n'data.frame':   344 obs. of  8 variables:\n $ species    : Factor w/ 3 levels \"1\",\"2\",\"3\": 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 ...\n $ island     : Factor w/ 3 levels \"Biscoe\",\"Dream\",..: 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 ...\n $ bill_len   : num  39.1 39.5 40.3 NA 36.7 39.3 38.9 39.2 34.1 42 ...\n $ bill_dep   : num  18.7 17.4 18 NA 19.3 20.6 17.8 19.6 18.1 20.2 ...\n $ flipper_len: int  181 186 195 NA 193 190 181 195 193 190 ...\n $ body_mass  : int  3750 3800 3250 NA 3450 3650 3625 4675 3475 4250 ...\n $ sex        : Factor w/ 2 levels \"female\",\"male\": 2 1 1 NA 1 2 1 2 NA NA ...\n $ year       : int  2007 2007 2007 2007 2007 2007 2007 2007 2007 2007 ...\n\n\nNow we see that species is a factor with three levels!\nNevertheless, factors are important and worth the pain. Many functions throughout the R landscape expect categorical variables to be coded as factors. For example, when making plots in either ggplot2 or in base R, we need factors in order to map categorical variables to aesthetic elements like colour.\nTo make our lives easier, we will work with factors through the forcats package loaded as part of the tidyverse.\n\nReordering Factor Levels\nBy default, factors are ordered alphabetically or numerically. However, in many cases factors have a logical ordering they should follow. For example, you may have an education variable dictating the level of schooling a student is currently in (i.e., elementary, secondary, post-secondary, graduate). It is natural to order the factor in this way. In other cases, you may just want to reorder the levels of a factor so that it plots a certain way. Reordering data can be useful for both data visualization and model fitting.\nTo see the current ordering of a factor variable, we can call levels().\n\nlevels(penguins$species)\n\n[1] \"Adelie\"    \"Chinstrap\" \"Gentoo\"   \n\n\nWe see here, the levels of the factor are ordered alphabetically.\n\nReordering Levels of a Factors Manually\nThere are many ways to reorder the levels of a factor in R. To reorder the levels of the factor, we can use built in R functions such as ordered():\n\npenguins3 &lt;- penguins %&gt;%\n  mutate(species = ordered(species, levels = c(\"Gentoo\", \"Chinstrap\", \"Adelie\"))) #change species to an ordered factor with the specified ordering\n\nlevels(penguins3$species) #see the levels of species\n\n[1] \"Gentoo\"    \"Chinstrap\" \"Adelie\"   \n\n\nNow, when we call str() on the penguins data, we see that the factor is explicitly ordered, with out new ordering:\n\nstr(penguins3)\n\n'data.frame':   344 obs. of  8 variables:\n $ species    : Ord.factor w/ 3 levels \"Gentoo\"&lt;\"Chinstrap\"&lt;..: 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 ...\n $ island     : Factor w/ 3 levels \"Biscoe\",\"Dream\",..: 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 ...\n $ bill_len   : num  39.1 39.5 40.3 NA 36.7 39.3 38.9 39.2 34.1 42 ...\n $ bill_dep   : num  18.7 17.4 18 NA 19.3 20.6 17.8 19.6 18.1 20.2 ...\n $ flipper_len: int  181 186 195 NA 193 190 181 195 193 190 ...\n $ body_mass  : int  3750 3800 3250 NA 3450 3650 3625 4675 3475 4250 ...\n $ sex        : Factor w/ 2 levels \"female\",\"male\": 2 1 1 NA 1 2 1 2 NA NA ...\n $ year       : int  2007 2007 2007 2007 2007 2007 2007 2007 2007 2007 ...\n\n\n\n\nReordering Levels of a Factors Based on a Condition Using forcats\nPerhaps we want to reorder levels based on some condition, perhaps the ordering levels by frequency, or perhaps by the another summary statistic (which could be useful for effective data visualization!). We can easily do so using the forcats package. Let’s look again at the original penguins data set and look at the frequency of each species using ggplot:\n\nggplot(penguins, aes(x = species, fill = species)) + #use species variable (no y needed)\n  geom_bar() + #draw a bar chart \n  theme(legend.position = \"none\")  + #remove redundant legend\n  xlab(\"Species\") + #add x axis label\n  ylab(\"Count\") + # add y axis label\n  ggtitle(\"Penguin Species Frequencies\") #add a title\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis data visualization is fine. But there’s one step we can do to make it even better: order bars by largest to smallest (or smallest to largest) so readers can easily spot which species is the most common. This is especially useful when the number of levels is large!\nWe can do this in two ways: edit the original tibble to have new factor ordering, or order the factors directly in the ggplot2 call so that the original tibble isn’t overwritted. We will show both ways. We will use the forcats package in both examples.\nOption A: Reorder Tibble Directly\nTo reorder the factor levels according to the frequency in the tibble, we can use fct_reorder():\n\npenguins4 &lt;- penguins #initialize a new dataset we will overwrite, save original\npenguins4$species &lt;- penguins$species %&gt;% #overwrite species in penguins4\n  fct_infreq() #relevel the factor by frequency\n\nlevels(penguins4$species)\n\n[1] \"Adelie\"    \"Gentoo\"    \"Chinstrap\"\n\n\nWe see the ordering is Adelie, Gentoo, and then Chinstrap. If you look at the previous plot, you’ll see that these are ordered from smallest to largest frequencies. The original ordering was alphabetical.\nTo order from smallest to largest, we had fct_rev() to the chain:\n\npenguins4$species &lt;- penguins4$species %&gt;%\n  fct_infreq() %&gt;% #relevel the factor by frequency\n  fct_rev()\n\nlevels(penguins4$species)\n\n[1] \"Chinstrap\" \"Gentoo\"    \"Adelie\"   \n\n\nNow the levels are reversed!\nWe can then plot our data using penguins4:\n\nggplot(penguins4, aes(x = species, fill = species)) + #use species variable (no y needed)\n  geom_bar() + #draw a bar chart \n  theme(legend.position = \"none\")  + #remove redundant legend  \n  xlab(\"Species\") + #add x axis label\n  ylab(\"Count\") + # add y axis label\n  ggtitle(\"Penguin Species Frequencies\") #add a title\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOf course, an even better visualization would involve flipping the axes:\n\nggplot(penguins4, aes(x = species, fill = species)) + #use species variable (no y needed)\n  geom_bar() + #draw a bar chart \n  theme(legend.position = \"none\")  + #remove redundant legend  \n  xlab(\"Species\") + #add x axis label\n  ylab(\"Count\") + # add y axis label\n  ggtitle(\"Penguin Species Frequencies\") + #add a title\n  coord_flip()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIt may look like they are ordered from largest to smallest, but they are actually ordered from smallest to largest. When flipped, ggplot puts the first level on the bottom.\n\n\nOption B: Reorder the Factor in the ggplot Call\nWe can do these steps directly in ggplot without overwriting or making a new tibble!\n\npenguins %&gt;% #this is the original data frame with alphabetical ordering\n  mutate(species = species %&gt;%\n           fct_infreq() %&gt;% #order by frequency\n           fct_rev()) %&gt;%  #reverse ordering\n  ggplot( aes(x = species, fill = species)) + #no longer specify the data set in ggplot() as this is passed in by the pipe %&gt;%\n    geom_bar() + \n    theme(legend.position = \"none\")  +\n    xlab(\"Species\") + \n    ylab(\"Count\") + \n    ggtitle(\"Penguin Species Frequencies\") + \n    coord_flip()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe get the exact same plot with a single chunk of code! And, the original tibble penguins remains unchanged with the alphabetical ordering of the species factors.\n\nlevels(penguins$species)\n\n[1] \"Adelie\"    \"Chinstrap\" \"Gentoo\"   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise\n\n\n\nThe gapminder dataset contains information on GDP per capita (gdpPercap) by country. Add to the following ggplot to visualize the GDP per capita, ordered by GDP per capita, for countries in Asia in 2007. Copy the code block to edit and run it in R.\nlibrary(gapminder)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\ngapminder %&gt;%\n  filter( ) %&gt;% #FILL THIS IN: filter by countries in Asia\n  mutate() %&gt;% #FILL THIS IN: change ordering of country by gdpPercap\n  ggplot(aes(country, gdpPercap)) + \n    geom_point() + \n    coord_flip() + \n    scale_y_continuous(\"GDP per Capita, 2007\", labels = scales::dollar_format()) + \n    xlab(\"Country\")\n  \n\n\nAnswer below! No peaking until you’ve attempted this problem!\n\ngapminder %&gt;%\n  filter(continent == \"Asia\", year == 2007) %&gt;% #filter by countries in Asia\n  mutate(country = fct_reorder(country, gdpPercap)) %&gt;% #change ordering of country by gdpPercap\n  ggplot(aes(country, gdpPercap)) + \n    geom_point() + \n    coord_flip() + \n    scale_y_continuous(\"GDP per Capita, 2007\", labels = scales::dollar_format()) + \n    xlab(\"Country\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExpanding Factor Levels\nPerhaps we may want to visualize that in our data set, there are no Emperor or King penguins. To do so, we can add “Emperor” and “King” as possible factor levels for species in our penguins data set. We do so by fct_expand()\n\npenguins %&gt;% #this is the original data frame with alphabetical ordering\n  mutate(species = species %&gt;%\n           fct_expand(\"King\", \"Emperor\") %&gt;% #NEW: expand levels to include king and emperor\n           fct_infreq() %&gt;% \n           fct_rev()\n           ) %&gt;%  \n  ggplot( aes(x = species, fill = species)) + \n    geom_bar() + \n    theme(legend.position = \"none\")  +\n    xlab(\"Species\") + \n    ylab(\"Count\") + \n    ggtitle(\"Penguin Species Frequencies\") + \n    coord_flip() + \n    scale_x_discrete(drop = FALSE) #NEW: do not drop empty factor levels\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow we add to the visualization that there were no King or Emperor penguins collected in the data.\n\nRemoving Factor Levels\nLet’s suppose we were only interested in comparing Adelie and Chinstrap penguins. We could drop the Gentoo level using forcats by:\n\npenguins_no_gentoo &lt;- penguins %&gt;%\n  filter(species %in% c(\"Adelie\", \"Chinstrap\")) %&gt;%\n  droplevels()\n\nlevels(penguins_no_gentoo$species)\n\n[1] \"Adelie\"    \"Chinstrap\"\n\n\nWe can also do this along with the ggplot call by:\n\npenguins %&gt;% #this is the original data frame with alphabetical ordering\n  mutate(species = species %&gt;%\n\n           fct_infreq() %&gt;% \n           fct_rev()\n           ) %&gt;%  \n  filter(species %in% c(\"Adelie\", \"Chinstrap\")) %&gt;% #NEW: filter only these species\n  droplevels() %&gt;% #NEW: drop if not adelie or chinstrap species\n  ggplot( aes(x = species, fill = species)) + \n    geom_bar() + \n    theme(legend.position = \"none\")  +\n    xlab(\"Species\") + \n    ylab(\"Count\") + \n    ggtitle(\"Penguin Species Frequencies\") + \n    coord_flip() + \n    scale_x_discrete(drop = FALSE) #NEW: do not drop empty factor levels"

    "section": "Why Automation",
    "text": "Why Automation\nIt often makes sense to break up a task (e.g. “analyze data and turn it into publication ready figures and tables”) into smaller chunks, e.g. “data cleaning” vs “summarizing and plotting” vs “model fitting”. This leads to a pipeline: a system where the code for some tasks (e.g. summarizing and plotting) depend on the output of others (e.g. data cleaning).\nOne of the major advantages to this paradigm: you no longer have to re-run all of the code every time you make a change. You only need to run the parts downstream from what you changed.\nBut how do we keep track of what needs to be re-run when we make changes in this system? We could do it by hand, but this is likely to cause human error (recall the reproducibility principle!). It’s much safer to automate. We will be learning how to use Makefiles for this purpose.\nThis will be challenging! But the payoff is huge for larger projects. Shaun Jackman gives an example of a Bioinformatics paper that is generated with a single Makefile that:\n\nDownloads the data\nRuns command-line programs\nPerforms the statistical analyses using R\nGenerates TSV tables\nRenders figures using ggplot2\nRenders supplementary material using RMarkdown\nRenders the manuscript using Pandoc\n\nAnd critically, knows which parts need to be run and which parts do not. Amazing, right?"

Instead of coding each step multiple times, let’s turn it into a function.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 1\n\n\n\nBy yourself or in small groups, try to turn the code above into a function called summarizeby_fun(). Document your code!\n\n\nWe will go over the solution in class.\n\n\nData-masking and the Curly-Curly {{}}\nSometimes your function needs to take in variable names without quotation marks and work with them that way.\nFor example, select(penguins, species) does not put quotation marks around lifeExp – the reasoning being that lifeExp is like a variable in our workspace, if we were to include column names in our R Environment – and select(\"penguins\", \"species\") will not do the same thing.\nIf your function needs to do this, then you need to work with the arguments with extra care inside the function definition. Whenever we use those arguments, we need to embrace them within two curly brackets – an operator called “curly curly”.\nTake this function that produces a quick scatterplot between two columns in a dataset as an example.\nquick_scatter &lt;- function(data, x, y) {\n  ggplot(data, aes(x, y)) + #note curly brackets here!\n     geom_point()\n}\n\nquick_scatter(penguins, bill_length_mm, body_mass_g)\nError in `geom_point()`:\n! Problem while computing aesthetics.\nℹ Error occurred in the 1st layer.\nCaused by error:\n! object 'bill_length_mm' not found\nWhy doesn’t this work? The reason is that R is looking for variables named bill_len and body_mass in the workspace, and cannot find them. To fix the problem, we can change the function definition so that `x` and `y` are embraced within two curly brackets {{}} (“curly curly”):\n\nquick_scatter &lt;- function(data, x, y) {\n  ggplot(data, aes({{ x }}, {{ y }})) + #note curly brackets here!\n     geom_point()\n}\n\nquick_scatter(penguins, bill_length_mm, body_mass_g)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut, you can only use curly-curly when passing your function’s argument to another function that’s anticipating a variable name without brackets.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nIn the `dplyr` documentation, if you spy the words “data masking” or “tidy selection”, then you will need to curly-curly your arguments when using those functions within your custom function.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 2\n\n\n\nMake a modification to our function summarizeby_fun(): allow the user to also pass in which variables they want to summarize. (Right now it just summarizes all of them.)\n\n\nWe will go over the solution in class.\n\n\nDefault Parameters\nRecall the dice-rolling example from the previous lecture. Sometimes you want to use a function frequently without re-writing the same parameters over and over again. Let’s make a more flexible function that allows us to change the number of faces on the dice being rolled.\n\n#' @details\n#' Simulates rolling `num_dice` number of dice with `n_sides` sides and outputs the sum.

We are also sampling from 1:nsides instead of 1:10 to make the function more flexible. I also renamed the function to roll_dice as we are not necessarily rolling d10 dice.\nSo to roll 2, 10-sided dice, I can call:\n\nroll_dice(n_sides = 10, num_dice = 2)\n\n[1] 10\n\n\nIf I wanted to make the default number of sides to 10, I can do that in the function()!\n\n#' @details\n#' Simulates rolling `num_dice` number of dice with `n_sides` sides and outputs the sum. Note: no seed is used so the function will return a dice combination each time it is run\n#'\n#' @param num_dice integer representing number of dice to be rolled\n#' @param n_sides integer representing the number of sides of each dice.

This means the function will assume we have a 10 sided dice unless otherwise specified. Let’s roll 3 dice using 10 sided dice (the default):\n\nroll_dice(num_dice = 3)\n\n[1] 12\n\n\nI didn’t need to include n_sides = 10 in my function call! But I can if I want to change it to a number other than 10. Let’s roll 3 standard 6-sided dice\n\nroll_dice(n_sides = 6, num_dice = 3)\n\n[1] 17\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 3\n\n\n\nMake a new argument for the summarizeby_fun() we made previously called .groups that makes it default to dropping the groups in the output.\n\n\n\n\nEllipses (...)\nThe ellipses allow a function to accept a variable number of additional unnamed arguments beyond what is explicitly written in the function. Many built-in functions have ... listed (check out c()!)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstructor Demo\n\n\n\nWe’ll modify our function together using ellipses to get extra functionality: we’ll allow the user to group by more than one variable.\n\n\n\n\nHandling NAs\nMissing data is essentially inevitable. Few studies are able to collect 100% of the data they intend to.\nMissing data can heavily complicate analyses and even lead to biased results when not handled properly. Missing data is a big research area in statistics! But for this class, we are going to focus on dealing with missing data using a simple example.\nLet’s look at the flipper length of penguins in the penguins data set and count how many missing values there are using the is.na() function in R. is.na(flipper_len) will return a vector full of TRUE or FALSE values indicating whether or not the observation was missing. As TRUE is coded as a 1 and FALSE as a 0, we can sum over these to count how many missing values there are.\n\nflipper_len &lt;- penguins$flipper_length_mm #save this data as its own vector\nsum(is.na(flipper_len)) # count how many NAs there are in the flipper data\n\n[1] 2\n\n\nWe see we have two missing values. Let’s see if we can summarize the quantiles of the lengths:\nquantile(flipper_len)\nError in quantile.default(flipper_length) :\nmissing values and NaN's not allowed if 'na.rm' is FALSE\nWe see here that missing values are not allowed unless we specify na.rm = TRUE. When na.rm = TRUE, we remove missing values from the data and then calculate the quantiles. This is also referred to as a complete case analysis.\n\nquantile(flipper_len, na.rm = TRUE)\n\n  0%  25%  50%  75% 100% \n 172  190  197  213  231 \n\n\nNow suppose we wanted to make our own function that utilized the quantile() built-in function:\n\n#' @details\n#' calculates the range of data by finding the 100th and 0th quantile and finding their difference\n#'\n#' @param vec a vector that we want to find the range of\n#' @return the difference in the maximum and minimum\n  \nget_range &lt;- function(vec){\n  quantiles &lt;- quantile(vec, na.rm = TRUE) #calc quantiles, remove NA's\n  return(max(quantiles) - min(quantiles)) #calculate and return the range\n}\n\nget_range(flipper_len)\n\n[1] 59\n\n\nWe could also include na.rm in our function parameters to allow the user to specify whether or not it should be set to TRUE or FALSE. We can use a default, as well.\n\n#' @details\n#' calculates the range of data by finding the 100th and 0th quantile and finding their difference\n#'\n#' @param vec a vector that we want to find the range of\n#' @param na.rm logical, whether or not to remove NAs.
