    "section": "Self-made R Functions",
    "text": "Self-made R Functions\nAt this point in the course, we’ve used lots of functions, like mean(), mutate(), and pivot_longer(). But it can be really useful to write your own function. For example, the ability to writing your own functions can supercharge your group_by() %&gt;% summarize() workflow: you can write your own function to use inside summarize(), instead of relying solely on functions built into R or available in packages!\nSo why write functions? In short, it avoids repeatedly duplicating code. This is helpful because:\n\nIt shortens your code – crucially, without losing interpretability – making it easier and faster to read through and process its overall intent.\nIf your needs change, then you only need to change your code in one place (the function definition) rather than a bunch of places.\nBullet points 1 and 2 mean that using functions typically leads to fewer bugs and fewer headaches.\n\nA good rule of thumb is whenever you find yourself repeating code more than a few times, consider writing a function.\nHere’s a simple example of a function I wrote to simulate rolling a user-inputted number of D10s (a 10-sided die used for tabletop gaming) and returning the sum of the dice.\n\nroll_d10 &lt;- function(num_dice) { \n    sum(sample(1:10, num_dice, replace=TRUE))\n}\n\nroll_d10(2)\n\n[1] 17\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThis is not reproducible code, as the output will change each time I run this function as I am randomly sampling. If I wanted to make this reproducible, then I would set the seed to (say) 123 before running my function with set.seed(123).\n\n\n\nDocumentation\nYou should have also noticed by now that other people’s functions in packages are documented - there’s information about:\n\nwhat the function does, at a high level\nthe objects it expects you to input\nthe object that the function outputs\n\nAt an absolute minimum, functions should have some comments indicating what the function does and what the inputs are. However, to make the function more user-friendly, commenting each line can be extremely helpful to let the user know exactly what’s happening under the hood. For example, we could comment the above function to make it more clear:\n\nroll_d10 &lt;- function(num_dice) { \n  # this function simulates rolling `num_dice` number of 10-sided dice and outputs the sum\n  # note: no seed is used so the function will return a dice combination each time it is run\n  #\n  # inputs:\n  # - num_dice: number of dice you wish to roll\n  \n    sum(sample(1:10, num_dice, replace=TRUE)) #sample two numbers with replacement between 1 and 10, return sum\n}\n\n# test function\nroll_d10(2)\n\n[1] 9\n\n\nWe can do even better than this wutg roxygen2 tags to document the function! These tags are placed immediately above the function definition. Although roxygen2 tags are designed for use when creating R packages, they provide a standardized way to document a function – and make it easy for you to migrate your function to an R package if need be! Roxygen comment lines always start with #' , the usual # for a comment, followed immediately by a single quote ':\n#' Description of function goes here\n#' \n#' @param x description of the parameter input x goes here\n#' @param y description of the parameter input x goes here\n#' @returns description of the what function returns goes here\n\nname_of_function &lt;- function(x, y) {\n  your function goes here!\n}\nFor the dice example, we could write:\n\n#' @details\n#' Simulates rolling `num_dice` number of dice for a 10 sided dice and outputs the sum. Note: no seed is used so the function will return a dice combination each time it is run\n#'\n#' @param num_dice integer representing number of dice to be rolled\n#' @return the sum of the dice rolled\n  \nroll_d10 &lt;- function(num_dice) { \n    sum(sample(1:10, num_dice, replace=TRUE)) #sample two numbers from one to 10 with replacement, return sum\n}\n\nroll_d10(2)\n\n[1] 19\n\n\n\n\nTesting\nWhen you’re using other people’s functions – like those in packages – they often work. However, as you have probably discovered by this point, it is very easy to inadvertently write code – and therefore functions – that do not work. Because of this, it’s important to test the functions we write to make sure they work. It is useful to ensure that\nIt’s useful to think of a few cases to test, along with edge cases (conditions that fall outside the typical or expected parameters) and see if the function performs\nLet’s try rolling 4 dice:\n\nroll_d10(4)\n\n[1] 23\n\n\nNow, let’s try rolling no dice. The expected output should be 0.\n\nroll_d10(0)\n\n[1] 0\n\n\nInstead of manually coding test cases over and over, we can use functions from the testthat package in R. For example, when rolling no dice, we would expect the output to be 0. We can use the expect_equal() function to confirm this. The function won’t output anything if the output is as expected:\n\nexpect_equal(roll_d10(0), 0)\n\nor will throw an error if not:\nexpect_equal(roll_d10(0), 2)\nError: roll_d10(0) not equal to 2.\n1/1 mismatches\n[1] 0 - 2 == -2\nThe test_that() function makes these tests even more readable:\n\ntest_that(\"Rolling no dice equals 0\", {\n  expect_equal(roll_d10(0), 0)\n})\n\nTest passed 🎊\n\n\nMore examples for the test_that() can be found on on this Video Lecture.\n\n\nError Handling\nLet’s try inputting a nonsense input, like 2.5 dice. This input doesn’t make sense, so let’s see what happens:\n\nroll_d10(2.5)\n\n[1] 8\n\n\nInteresting! This is something we should consider controlling for when creating our function.\nWithin a function call, we can force errors to appear using the stop() function and conditional statements. For example, we may only want to allow whole numbers (positive numbers of dice) to be inputs. We can do this by seeing if the num_dice %% 1function returns 0. %% is the “modular division” function which returns the remainder after division. Whole numbers will not have any remainder when divided by 1. Let’s update our function:\n\n#' @details\n#' Simulates rolling `num_dice` number of dice and outputs the sum. Note: no seed is used so the function will return a dice combination each time it is run\n#'\n#' @param num_dice integer representing number of dice to be rolled\n#' @return the sum of the dice rolled\n  \nroll_d10 &lt;- function(num_dice) { \n  \n    # throw an error if num_dice (the input) is not an integer\n  \n    if(num_dice %% 1 != 0){ #if num_dice mod 1 is NOT 0\n      stop(\"num_dice must be an integer\") #throw this error message and stop the function\n    }\n  \n    #if the num_dice is an integer, continue with the function:\n    sum(sample(1:10, num_dice, replace=TRUE)) #sample two numbers from one to 10 with replacement, return sum\n}\n\nSo rolling 2 dice shouldn’t throw an error:\n\nroll_d10(2)\n\n[1] 14\n\n\nBut rolling 2.5 dice should:\nroll_d10(2.5)\nError in roll_d10(2.5) : num_dice must be an integer\nOur function is working as expected for this edge case!\n\n\nReturns\nBy default, your function will return the last thing computed in your function. However, we can return other items, like lists and vectors and dataframes using return().\nWhile perhaps redundant as the last line of code here is what we want to output, we could explictly tell R what to output by:\n\n#' @details\n#' Simulates rolling `num_dice` number of dice with `n_sides` sides and outputs the sum. Note: no seed is used so the function will return a dice combination each time it is run\n#'\n#' @param num_dice integer representing number of dice to be rolled\n#' @return the sum of the dice rolled\n  \nroll_d10 &lt;- function(num_dice) { \n  \n    # throw an error if num_dice (the input) is not an integer\n  \n    if(num_dice %% 1 != 0){ #if num_dice mod 1 is NOT 0\n      stop(\"num_dice must be an integer\") #throw this error message and stop the function\n    }\n  \n    #if the num_dice is an integer, continue with the function:\n    sum_dice &lt;- sum(sample(1:10, num_dice, replace=TRUE)) #sample two numbers from one to 10 with replacement, save as sum_dice\n    \n    #output\n    return(sum_dice)\n}\n\nWe could also return a vector of the the number of dice, and the number of faces of each dice, and the sum.\n\n#' @details\n#' Simulates rolling `num_dice` number of dice with `n_sides` sides and outputs the sum. Note: no seed is used so the function will return a dice combination each time it is run\n#'\n#' @param num_dice integer representing number of dice to be rolled\n#' @param n_sides integer representing the number of sides of each dice.\n#' @return the sum of the dice rolled\n  \nroll_d10 &lt;- function(n_sides, num_dice) { \n  \n    # throw an error if num_dice (the input) is not an integer\n  \n    if(num_dice %% 1 != 0){ #if num_dice mod 1 is NOT 0\n      stop(\"num_dice must be an integer\") #throw this error message and stop the function\n    }\n  \n    #if the num_dice is an integer, continue with the function:\n    sum_dice &lt;- sum(sample(1:10, num_dice, replace=TRUE)) #sample two numbers from one to 10 with replacement, return sum\n    \n    out &lt;- c(num_dice, sum_dice) #create a vector of what we want to return\n    \n    return(out)\n    \n}\n\nroll_d10(num_dice = 5)\n\n[1]  5 23\n\n\nLooks like we rolled 5 dice and the sum was 23."

    "text": "Iteration\nIf you programmed before, you probably have an idea of how to do this with a for loop.

This has the advantage of making our code even more readable and compact, since we’re expressing the same logic with less space. Here’s an example using purrr::map_dbl() and a custom function:\n\npurrr::map_dbl(1:10, function(x) x^2)\n\n [1]   1   4   9  16  25  36  49  64  81 100\n\n\nThe first argument specifies the list/vector we want to iterate over, and the second argument specifies a function that we want to apply to each entry. Options for specifying functions include the name of a function, a fully specified custom function (as demonstrated above), or one of the “shortcuts” the purrr developers have provided.\nHere are two examples of “shortcuts”:\n\npurrr::map_dbl(1:10, ~ (.x)^2)\n\n [1]   1   4   9  16  25  36  49  64  81 100\n\n\n\npurrr::map_dbl(1:10, \\(x) x^2)\n\n [1]   1   4   9  16  25  36  49  64  81 100\n\n\nThe second one is easier to remember and appears to be the one that purrr developers are recommending now; see the purrr cheatsheat. But this change in recommendation appears to have happened around 2022/2023, so you may still see the first type of shortcut in many places in the wild."

She – and many students – felt there was a lot of great, relevant content that could go into an additional 1.5 credits.\nA full semester of data exploration, visualization, and all-around data wrangling was piloted in 2014/2015. It was structured as two half courses primarily so that several year’s worth of STAT 545A alums could register for the second part (then STAT 547M) and get the “missing half” of the course. And now it’s hard to break the cycle."

All assessments are graded on a pass/fail basis for those officially auditing.\nYou must be registered as an auditing student to attend lectures due to capacity limitations.\n\n\nCourse Communications\nWe will be using Slack as our primary platform of all course-related communications! Students will be emailed an invite to their class’ Slack workspace.\nOfficial course communications will occur on the #announcements channel. You will receive an invite on the first day of classes. Please notify the instructor by email if you have not received your personal invite.\nOur STAT 545 team will be actively monitoring Slack during regular working hours (9am to 5pm PT, Monday to Friday). You are free to ask questions outside of this window but please keep in mind that there are no expectations for the team to answer questions outside of working hours or on weekends or holidays.\nTo make the most out of Slack, please\n\nUse the #general channel for clarifications, asking about course organization, or clarifying instructions. Things you post on the #general channel will be seen by everyone, so please do not provide information that gives away answers to assignments.\nMake a group chat with our TAs when you need more personalized help, or have an issue with grading. They may direct you to the #general channel when appropriate, or direct you to the instructor.\nDirect message the instructor if there is a concern that is more personal (i.e., you need to self declare an absense) or if you have already talked to the TAs about an issue and are unsatisfied. You can also direct message the instructor if you are having issues with a group member in any group-related assignments.\nPost in the #random channel if you find things related to the course that you’d like to share\n\n\n\nPrivacy\nSlack and GitHub are hosted on servers stored outside of Canada. Please keep this in mind.\n\n\nPolicies\n\nRegrade Requests\nRegrade requests must be sent to the TAs through Slack within one week of the assessment being returned. If required, regrade requests can be escalated to the instructor only if the request has already been brought up to the TA team and the student is unsatisfied. The instructor reserves the right to regrade the entire assessment, resulting in a higher or lower mark than originally provided.\n\n\nLate Policies\nWorksheets (and larger assignments, if applicable) are due at 11:59pm PT on the date indicated in the course schedule. For a late submission, a 24 hour extension will be provided for the first offense. Late submissions will be given a grade of 0 for subsequent occurrences.\nThere is a zero-tolerance policy for late projects, including the mini data analysis and the collaborative project. If you are having issues with a team member regarding any group work, reach out to the instructor directly through Slack or email.\n\n\nAcademic Concession\nUBC no longer requires a doctor’s note (or supporting documentation) for academic concession. A self-declaration will suffice – here is a template you can use. The form is also posted on our Canvas page. Please submit this to the instructor via email.\nExamples of “conflicting responsibility” are conference travel and time-sensitive field work.\nIf you arrange to have an assignment submitted late, you may not be able to receive feedback from your peers.\n\n\nPlagiarism\nPlagiarism, which is intellectual theft, occurs where an individual submits or presents the oral or written work of another person as his or her own and can include:\n\nmultiple students submitting the same response\ncopying from sources without citing them\ncopying verbatim (word-for-word) from source and citing, but failing to make it explicit that this is a quotation (quotations should be used only rarely, if at all)\n\nStudents are responsible for ensuring that any work submitted does not constitute plagiarism. Students who are in any doubt as to what constitutes plagiarism should consult their instructor before handing in any assignments.\nFor more information see the UBC Academic Misconduct policies.\n\n\nCode Plagiarism\nStudents must correctly cite any code that has been authored by someone else or by the student themselves for other assignments. Cases of code plagiarism may include, but are not limited to:\n\nthe reproduction (copying and pasting) of code with none or minimal reformatting (e.g., changing the name of the variables)\nthe translation of an algorithm or a script from a language to another\nthe generation of code by automatic code-generations software\n\nAn “adequate acknowledgement” requires a detailed identification of the (parts of the) code reused and a full citation of the original source code that has been reused.\n\n\nUBC’s Policies and Resources to Support Student Success\nUBC provides resources to support student learning and to maintain healthy lifestyles but recognizes that sometimes crises arise and so there are additional resources to access including those for survivors of sexual violence. UBC values respect for the person and ideas of all members of the academic community. Harassment and discrimination are not tolerated nor is suppression of academic freedom. UBC provides appropriate accommodation for students with disabilities and for religious, spiritual and cultural observances. UBC values academic honesty and students are expected to acknowledge the ideas generated by others and to uphold the highest academic standards in all of their actions. Details of the policies and how to access support are available here.\n\n\nYour personal health\nIf you’re sick, it’s important that you stay home – no matter what you think you may be sick with (e.g., cold, flu, other). Your precautions will help reduce risk and keep everyone safer. The structure of this class is intended to provide flexibility so that you can prioritize your health and still be able to succeed.\nIf you do miss class because of illness:\n\nConsult the class resources on the course website\nCome to office hours on Zoom.\nUse Slack to carry out discussions.\n\nIf you miss an assessment due to illness, see the above section on Academic Concessions, and review the UBC policy here: http://www.calendar.ubc.ca/vancouver/index.cfm?tree=3,329,0,0\nAbove all, please take care of yourself and be kind to yourself and your classmates. If you or anyone you know experiences any academic stress, difficult life events, or feelings like anxiety or depression, I strongly encourage you to seek support. UBC Counseling Services is here to help: call 604 822 3811 or visit their website. Consider also reaching out to a friend, faculty member, or family member you trust to help get you the support you need.\n\n\nInstructor health\nIf I am ill, then I will not come to class. If that happens, here’s what you can expect:\n\nIf I am well enough to teach, I will conduct virtual lectures through Zoom until I am well. If this happens, you will be tagged in an announcement via Slack with information. You can anticipate that this would very likely be a last minute announcement. Our classroom will still be available for you to sit and attend an online session, although it is recommended that you bring headphones.\nIf I am not well enough to teach, it is possible that one or more teaching assistants will take my place. But if not, we will either try to make up for lost time, make new resources to aid in your learning, or make accommodations regarding the assessments.\n\n\n\n\nCopyright\nCourse materials are licensed under Creative Commons 4.0.\n\n\n\n\n Back to top",

    "text": "Exercise 0: Merge one Pull Request per teammate\n30 points\nThis exercise is identical to the one in Deliverable 1.\nEach pull request will require a number of components (listed below). TAs will grade one pull request per person, and it’s up to you to ensure you’ve indicated which one is to be graded by adding “(GRADED)” to your pull request name.\nEvery teammate should submit at least one pull request for this deliverable, and have a different teammate merge the pull request after reviewing the contents of the pull request. So, like the previous exercise on Markdown Formatting, this exercise is not stand-alone. You’ll need to decide who will work on what.\nAs a reminder, in order to make a pull request, you’ll need to:\n\nMake a new branch, before you start working on your tasks! (So that you capture your work within the branch.)\n\nYou can do this either on GitHub, or on your own computer using RStudio.\n\nMake changes to some files on the new branch.\n\nYou can do this either on GitHub or on your own computer (locally), but if you do this locally, you’ll need to remember to push your work (on the branch) to GitHub.\n\nStart a pull request on GitHub, by going to “Pull Requests” -&gt; “New Pull Request”, and selecting the branch you intend to merge to the main branch. In your pull request, include a comment and title indicating (at a high level) what this change you made is about.\n\n\nIn the comments, include some indication as to which teammate will be responsible for checking and merging the new work contained in the pull request.\n\nPerhaps you’ve already decided up front who will be reviewing who’s work.\nOr perhaps (and more realistically), in your comment, you may ask the group at large who would like to volunteer, and then someone will respond.\nHow you work this out should go in your teamwork document (as described in another exercise).\n\nThe teammate responsible for reviewing and merging the pull request does so, being sure to add to the discussion happening in the pull request by adding a comment.\n\nThe comment could be as simple as something like “I’ve reviewed these changes, and everything looks great.” Or, it could highlight some issues that were found, in which case the team should work towards resolving the issue.\n\n\nNote 1: Work together as a team to get this done. If one of your teammates is having trouble with this procedure, help them out! Sometimes a merge conflict will happen, and it’s best to work as a team to figure out how to resolve these issues.\nNote 2: Please indicate to the TAs which PRs you would like to be graded by adding “(GRADED)” to the PR name. Every team member should have exactly one pull request labelled “(GRADED)”.\nGrading:\n\n4 points awarded for the creation of a complete set of pull requests (i.e., one pull request per teammate).\n14 points awarded for the successful merging of a complete set of pull requests.\n4 points awarded for the comment(s) kicking off the pull request.\n4 points awarded for the follow-up comment(s) from a reviewer.\n4 points awarded if each teammate gets the chance to act as a reviewer/merger of someone else’s pull request.\nPenalty of up to 4 points if the total amount of work contained in pull requests does not amount to much. We just want to make sure that, when you’re working on this project, you’re largely working on branches. It’s OK to commit directly to the main branch without a pull request, but this should be the exception, not the norm.\nPenalty of 1 point if you have not indicated to the TAs which PRs you would like to be graded by adding “(GRADED)” to the PR name.",

    "section": "Factors",
    "text": "Factors\n\n“There is no other object that creates as much trouble as factors.” - Patrick Burns, “The R Inferno”.\n\nIn R, we use factors to represent categorical variables: variables that take on a fixed number of known values (i.e. levels). For example, in the penguins data set, species is a factor with three levels: “Adelie”, “Chinstrap”, and “Gentoo”. We can see this by looking at the str() (structure) of the tibble:\n\nstr(penguins)\n\n'data.frame':   344 obs. of  8 variables:\n $ species    : Factor w/ 3 levels \"Adelie\",\"Chinstrap\",..: 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ...\n $ island     : Factor w/ 3 levels \"Biscoe\",\"Dream\",..: 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 ...\n $ bill_len   : num  39.1 39.5 40.3 NA 36.7 39.3 38.9 39.2 34.1 42 ...\n $ bill_dep   : num  18.7 17.4 18 NA 19.3 20.6 17.8 19.6 18.1 20.2 ...\n $ flipper_len: int  181 186 195 NA 193 190 181 195 193 190 ...\n $ body_mass  : int  3750 3800 3250 NA 3450 3650 3625 4675 3475 4250 ...\n $ sex        : Factor w/ 2 levels \"female\",\"male\": 2 1 1 NA 1 2 1 2 NA NA ...\n $ year       : int  2007 2007 2007 2007 2007 2007 2007 2007 2007 2007 ...\n\n\nor we can explicitly look at the class and levels of the variable of interest by:\n\nclass(penguins$species)\n\n[1] \"factor\"\n\nlevels(penguins$species)\n\n[1] \"Adelie\"    \"Chinstrap\" \"Gentoo\"   \n\n\nUnder the hood, R stores a factor with (say) 3 levels as a numeric vector containing integers between 1 and 3, paired with a character vector of length 3 that identifies the mapping between the numbers 1, 2, and 3 and the levels.\nThis is not immediately obvious, because R will print factors using the character string levels rather than the numbers that it stores:\n\nset.seed(100) #make reproducible (more on this later)\n\npenguins %&gt;% \n  slice_sample(n=10) %&gt;% #take 10 random rows\n  pull(species) #output the species only\n\n [1] Gentoo    Adelie    Gentoo    Adelie    Chinstrap Chinstrap Adelie   \n [8] Adelie    Gentoo    Chinstrap\nLevels: Adelie Chinstrap Gentoo\n\n\nThis dual nature of factors creates a whole slew of hidden traps and headaches, especially for new R users!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCaution\n\n\n\nSometimes factors are coded (i.e., written) in the data as integers. Without explicitly telling R, R will assume any numeric data are just regular old numbers.\nAlways ensure that factors are explicit in your code!\n\n\nFor example, suppose in the penguins data set than instead of their names, species had levels “1”, “2”, and “3’ where”1” could represent Gentoo, “2” Adelie, and 3 “Chinstrap” penguins. So, instead of having the names of penguin species as strings, they are coded as numeric values.\n\npenguins2 &lt;- penguins %&gt;%\n  mutate(species = recode(species, \"Gentoo\" = 1, \"Adelie\" = 2, \"Chinstrap\" = 3))\n\nstr(penguins2)\n\n'data.frame':   344 obs. of  8 variables:\n $ species    : num  2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 ...\n $ island     : Factor w/ 3 levels \"Biscoe\",\"Dream\",..: 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 ...\n $ bill_len   : num  39.1 39.5 40.3 NA 36.7 39.3 38.9 39.2 34.1 42 ...\n $ bill_dep   : num  18.7 17.4 18 NA 19.3 20.6 17.8 19.6 18.1 20.2 ...\n $ flipper_len: int  181 186 195 NA 193 190 181 195 193 190 ...\n $ body_mass  : int  3750 3800 3250 NA 3450 3650 3625 4675 3475 4250 ...\n $ sex        : Factor w/ 2 levels \"female\",\"male\": 2 1 1 NA 1 2 1 2 NA NA ...\n $ year       : int  2007 2007 2007 2007 2007 2007 2007 2007 2007 2007 ...\n\n\nWe see here that R assumes that species is a numeric variable, not a categorical variable. To ensure R knows that species is categorical, we can use:\n\npenguins2 &lt;- penguins2 %&gt;% #overwrite existing tibble\n  mutate(species = as.factor(species)) #overwrite species to be a factor using as.factor\n\nstr(penguins2)\n\n'data.frame':   344 obs. of  8 variables:\n $ species    : Factor w/ 3 levels \"1\",\"2\",\"3\": 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 ...\n $ island     : Factor w/ 3 levels \"Biscoe\",\"Dream\",..: 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 ...\n $ bill_len   : num  39.1 39.5 40.3 NA 36.7 39.3 38.9 39.2 34.1 42 ...\n $ bill_dep   : num  18.7 17.4 18 NA 19.3 20.6 17.8 19.6 18.1 20.2 ...\n $ flipper_len: int  181 186 195 NA 193 190 181 195 193 190 ...\n $ body_mass  : int  3750 3800 3250 NA 3450 3650 3625 4675 3475 4250 ...\n $ sex        : Factor w/ 2 levels \"female\",\"male\": 2 1 1 NA 1 2 1 2 NA NA ...\n $ year       : int  2007 2007 2007 2007 2007 2007 2007 2007 2007 2007 ...\n\n\nNow we see that species is a factor with three levels!\nNevertheless, factors are important and worth the pain. Many functions throughout the R landscape expect categorical variables to be coded as factors. For example, when making plots in either ggplot2 or in base R, we need factors in order to map categorical variables to aesthetic elements like colour.\nTo make our lives easier, we will work with factors through the forcats package loaded as part of the tidyverse.\n\nReordering Factor Levels\nBy default, factors are ordered alphabetically or numerically. However, in many cases factors have a logical ordering they should follow. For example, you may have an education variable dictating the level of schooling a student is currently in (i.e., elementary, secondary, post-secondary, graduate). It is natural to order the factor in this way. In other cases, you may just want to reorder the levels of a factor so that it plots a certain way. Reordering data can be useful for both data visualization and model fitting.\nTo see the current ordering of a factor variable, we can call levels().\n\nlevels(penguins$species)\n\n[1] \"Adelie\"    \"Chinstrap\" \"Gentoo\"   \n\n\nWe see here, the levels of the factor are ordered alphabetically.\n\nReordering Levels of a Factors Manually\nThere are many ways to reorder the levels of a factor in R. To reorder the levels of the factor, we can use built in R functions such as ordered():\n\npenguins3 &lt;- penguins %&gt;%\n  mutate(species = ordered(species, levels = c(\"Gentoo\", \"Chinstrap\", \"Adelie\"))) #change species to an ordered factor with the specified ordering\n\nlevels(penguins3$species) #see the levels of species\n\n[1] \"Gentoo\"    \"Chinstrap\" \"Adelie\"   \n\n\nNow, when we call str() on the penguins data, we see that the factor is explicitly ordered, with out new ordering:\n\nstr(penguins3)\n\n'data.frame':   344 obs. of  8 variables:\n $ species    : Ord.factor w/ 3 levels \"Gentoo\"&lt;\"Chinstrap\"&lt;..: 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 ...\n $ island     : Factor w/ 3 levels \"Biscoe\",\"Dream\",..: 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 ...\n $ bill_len   : num  39.1 39.5 40.3 NA 36.7 39.3 38.9 39.2 34.1 42 ...\n $ bill_dep   : num  18.7 17.4 18 NA 19.3 20.6 17.8 19.6 18.1 20.2 ...\n $ flipper_len: int  181 186 195 NA 193 190 181 195 193 190 ...\n $ body_mass  : int  3750 3800 3250 NA 3450 3650 3625 4675 3475 4250 ...\n $ sex        : Factor w/ 2 levels \"female\",\"male\": 2 1 1 NA 1 2 1 2 NA NA ...\n $ year       : int  2007 2007 2007 2007 2007 2007 2007 2007 2007 2007 ...\n\n\n\n\nReordering Levels of a Factors Based on a Condition Using forcats\nPerhaps we want to reorder levels based on some condition, perhaps the ordering levels by frequency, or perhaps by the another summary statistic (which could be useful for effective data visualization!). We can easily do so using the forcats package. Let’s look again at the original penguins data set and look at the frequency of each species using ggplot:\n\nggplot(penguins, aes(x = species, fill = species)) + #use species variable (no y needed)\n  geom_bar() + #draw a bar chart \n  theme(legend.position = \"none\")  + #remove redundant legend\n  xlab(\"Species\") + #add x axis label\n  ylab(\"Count\") + # add y axis label\n  ggtitle(\"Penguin Species Frequencies\") #add a title\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis data visualization is fine. But there’s one step we can do to make it even better: order bars by largest to smallest (or smallest to largest) so readers can easily spot which species is the most common. This is especially useful when the number of levels is large!\nWe can do this in two ways: edit the original tibble to have new factor ordering, or order the factors directly in the ggplot2 call so that the original tibble isn’t overwritted. We will show both ways. We will use the forcats package in both examples.\nOption A: Reorder Tibble Directly\nTo reorder the factor levels according to the frequency in the tibble, we can use fct_reorder():\n\npenguins4 &lt;- penguins #initialize a new dataset we will overwrite, save original\npenguins4$species &lt;- penguins$species %&gt;% #overwrite species in penguins4\n  fct_infreq() #relevel the factor by frequency\n\nlevels(penguins4$species)\n\n[1] \"Adelie\"    \"Gentoo\"    \"Chinstrap\"\n\n\nWe see the ordering is Adelie, Gentoo, and then Chinstrap. If you look at the previous plot, you’ll see that these are ordered from smallest to largest frequencies. The original ordering was alphabetical.\nTo order from smallest to largest, we had fct_rev() to the chain:\n\npenguins4$species &lt;- penguins4$species %&gt;%\n  fct_infreq() %&gt;% #relevel the factor by frequency\n  fct_rev()\n\nlevels(penguins4$species)\n\n[1] \"Chinstrap\" \"Gentoo\"    \"Adelie\"   \n\n\nNow the levels are reversed!\nWe can then plot our data using penguins4:\n\nggplot(penguins4, aes(x = species, fill = species)) + #use species variable (no y needed)\n  geom_bar() + #draw a bar chart \n  theme(legend.position = \"none\")  + #remove redundant legend  \n  xlab(\"Species\") + #add x axis label\n  ylab(\"Count\") + # add y axis label\n  ggtitle(\"Penguin Species Frequencies\") #add a title\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOf course, an even better visualization would involve flipping the axes:\n\nggplot(penguins4, aes(x = species, fill = species)) + #use species variable (no y needed)\n  geom_bar() + #draw a bar chart \n  theme(legend.position = \"none\")  + #remove redundant legend  \n  xlab(\"Species\") + #add x axis label\n  ylab(\"Count\") + # add y axis label\n  ggtitle(\"Penguin Species Frequencies\") + #add a title\n  coord_flip()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIt may look like they are ordered from largest to smallest, but they are actually ordered from smallest to largest. When flipped, ggplot puts the first level on the bottom.\n\n\nOption B: Reorder the Factor in the ggplot Call\nWe can do these steps directly in ggplot without overwriting or making a new tibble!\n\npenguins %&gt;% #this is the original data frame with alphabetical ordering\n  mutate(species = species %&gt;%\n           fct_infreq() %&gt;% #order by frequency\n           fct_rev()) %&gt;%  #reverse ordering\n  ggplot( aes(x = species, fill = species)) + #no longer specify the data set in ggplot() as this is passed in by the pipe %&gt;%\n    geom_bar() + \n    theme(legend.position = \"none\")  +\n    xlab(\"Species\") + \n    ylab(\"Count\") + \n    ggtitle(\"Penguin Species Frequencies\") + \n    coord_flip()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe get the exact same plot with a single chunk of code! And, the original tibble penguins remains unchanged with the alphabetical ordering of the species factors.\n\nlevels(penguins$species)\n\n[1] \"Adelie\"    \"Chinstrap\" \"Gentoo\"   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise\n\n\n\nThe gapminder dataset contains information on GDP per capita (gdpPercap) by country. Add to the following ggplot to visualize the GDP per capita, ordered by GDP per capita, for countries in Asia in 2007. Copy the code block to edit and run it in R.\nlibrary(gapminder)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\ngapminder %&gt;%\n  filter( ) %&gt;% #FILL THIS IN: filter by countries in Asia\n  mutate() %&gt;% #FILL THIS IN: change ordering of country by gdpPercap\n  ggplot(aes(country, gdpPercap)) + \n    geom_point() + \n    coord_flip() + \n    scale_y_continuous(\"GDP per Capita, 2007\", labels = scales::dollar_format()) + \n    xlab(\"Country\")\n  \n\n\nAnswer below! No peaking until you’ve attempted this problem!\n\ngapminder %&gt;%\n  filter(continent == \"Asia\", year == 2007) %&gt;% #filter by countries in Asia\n  mutate(country = fct_reorder(country, gdpPercap)) %&gt;% #change ordering of country by gdpPercap\n  ggplot(aes(country, gdpPercap)) + \n    geom_point() + \n    coord_flip() + \n    scale_y_continuous(\"GDP per Capita, 2007\", labels = scales::dollar_format()) + \n    xlab(\"Country\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExpanding Factor Levels\nPerhaps we may want to visualize that in our data set, there are no Emperor or King penguins. To do so, we can add “Emperor” and “King” as possible factor levels for species in our penguins data set. We do so by fct_expand()\n\npenguins %&gt;% #this is the original data frame with alphabetical ordering\n  mutate(species = species %&gt;%\n           fct_expand(\"King\", \"Emperor\") %&gt;% #NEW: expand levels to include king and emperor\n           fct_infreq() %&gt;% \n           fct_rev()\n           ) %&gt;%  \n  ggplot( aes(x = species, fill = species)) + \n    geom_bar() + \n    theme(legend.position = \"none\")  +\n    xlab(\"Species\") + \n    ylab(\"Count\") + \n    ggtitle(\"Penguin Species Frequencies\") + \n    coord_flip() + \n    scale_x_discrete(drop = FALSE) #NEW: do not drop empty factor levels\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow we add to the visualization that there were no King or Emperor penguins collected in the data.\n\nRemoving Factor Levels\nLet’s suppose we were only interested in comparing Adelie and Chinstrap penguins. We could drop the Gentoo level using forcats by:\n\npenguins_no_gentoo &lt;- penguins %&gt;%\n  filter(species %in% c(\"Adelie\", \"Chinstrap\")) %&gt;%\n  droplevels()\n\nlevels(penguins_no_gentoo$species)\n\n[1] \"Adelie\"    \"Chinstrap\"\n\n\nWe can also do this along with the ggplot call by:\n\npenguins %&gt;% #this is the original data frame with alphabetical ordering\n  mutate(species = species %&gt;%\n\n           fct_infreq() %&gt;% \n           fct_rev()\n           ) %&gt;%  \n  filter(species %in% c(\"Adelie\", \"Chinstrap\")) %&gt;% #NEW: filter only these species\n  droplevels() %&gt;% #NEW: drop if not adelie or chinstrap species\n  ggplot( aes(x = species, fill = species)) + \n    geom_bar() + \n    theme(legend.position = \"none\")  +\n    xlab(\"Species\") + \n    ylab(\"Count\") + \n    ggtitle(\"Penguin Species Frequencies\") + \n    coord_flip() + \n    scale_x_discrete(drop = FALSE) #NEW: do not drop empty factor levels"

Why? Think about this:\n\nAre there 365 days in every year?\nAre there 30 days in every month?\nAre there 24 hours in every day?\n\nThe answer to all of these questions is NO. What a headache this can be when trying to compute how much time has elapsed between two date/times!\nThe lubridate package can help us with a lot of the headaches that dates and times cause. It can create date and time objects from different inputs, extract important pieces of information like year/month/day, do hard math with dates and times, and help you navigate time zones."

    "section": "Reproducibility",
    "text": "Reproducibility\nReproducibility is the ability of an independent researcher to repeat an experiment using the same data and workflow to obtain the same results [1]. One way to ensure reproducible research is sharing clear details on the analysis and providing the code used to produce the results. Reproducibility is often confused with replication. However, replication is a separate concept where the results of a study should be validated on an independent study using new data. A “good” study is both replicable and reproducible.\nThere are also ethical benefits to reproducible research [1]. Performing open research can reduce the chance of data fabrication or other ethical issues such as p-hacking, where a researcher tests a number of hypotheses until they find one that is statistically significant. Open, transparent research poses a sense of accountability on the researcher(s). Of course, you can’t always share data (for example, health data containing personal identifying information), but you should share as much as is possible. Always check with your ethics board or principal investigator before sharing data online.\nReproducible studies can also advance research by providing the code used for analysis. Not only can we reproduce the study to make the findings more trustworthy, but we can learn more about how the analysis was performed and possibly apply it to other studies.\nReproducible research can also force you to have better, more automated workflows. The first analysis I ever did in R, I was manually changing things in excel documents, and then saving them in a certain place, and then using R to fit a model, and then exporting the data, and then changing the worksheet format, and so on. I had a sticky note of instructions on how to produce the results on my desk. This was neither reproducible nor productive for my time. While automating some steps and using tools like GitHub for version control can be more work upfront, it can save you a lot of headaches down the road. It is something I personally wish I learned to use earlier in my career.",

    "text": "R Markdown\nUsing an editor like MS Word is like painting: you decorate the page with text, graphs, and tables, making sure things are positioned, sized, and coloured appropriately.\nThis is great for a letter to a friend, but is less great for scientific work, because it hampers reproducibility and shareability.\nR Markdown lets you write a single “blueprint” for your analysis that includes everything - positioning/sizing/colouring/formatting, analysis/graph/table code and results, and text – and then “knit” all of those components together into a complete report with a single button press.\nThere is a large community of R Markdown users, making it easy to find tutorials and blog posts about a ton of different types of documents. We’re going to start simple and dive right into R Markdown.\n\nGetting Started with Markdown\nIn lecture, we are going to work through this online Markdown tutorial together in small groups. Challenge yourself to meet someone new in the class!\nAfter completing the tutorial, try making your own R Markdown document!\n\nIn RStudio, go to “File” -&gt; “New File” -&gt; “Markdown File”\nWrite a Markdown document all about you that includes:\n\nA header\nA link to your GitHub profile\nA list of courses you’re taking this semester\n\nClick the “Preview” button to generate an output .html file from the source .md file.\n\n\n\nInstall RMarkdown\n\nTo get started with using R Markdown, you’ll need to install the rmarkdown and DT R packages package.\ninstall.packages('rmarkdown')\ninstall.packages('DT')\n\n\n\nCreate an R Markdown file by going to File &gt; New File &gt; R Markdown..\n\nChange the title to “STAT545 Lecture 2a” and save the defaults. Click OK.\n\nClick the “Knit” button to generate the default document.\n\nThings to notice:\n\nThe YAML header is contained between two — at the top of the .Rmd source, and contains metadata on the document. This is where you specify the output type to be HTML.\nText is formatted using Markdown. There are three chunks of R code, and knitting executes the R code and displays the output in the output file.\n\nHow does it all work?\nThe key drivers under the hood are knitrand Pandoc! When you press “Knit”, R Markdown passes the .Rmdfile to knitr, which executes all of the code and creates a new .md file including the code and output. Then, that .md file is processed into the final output format (e.g. .html) by pandoc.\nWhat if I want a PDF?\nYou’ll need to install LaTeX and set the document type as a PDF document. TinyTeX is recommended:\ninstall.packages('tinytex')\ntinytex::install_tinytex()  # install TinyTeX\nFor this lecture, we will be knitting to HTML.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise: Edit Your YAML in Small Groups:\n\n\n\nRun ?html_document from your R console and/or check out Yihui Xie’s RMarkdown book to:\n\nAdd a floating table of contents\nAdd a theme.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstructor demo: mtcars Report\n\n\n\nTo follow along, download the mtcars_demonstration.Rmd file from the STAT545 GitHub and open it in RStudio. You can also refer back to this YouTube video to follow along!\n\n\n\nCode Chunk Options\nAs we saw in the demo, we can add code chunks using by selecting “Code” &gt; “Insert Chunk”, or use a keyboard shortcut: cmd + option + I(MAC) / ctrl + alt + i(WINDOWS). We can also toggle to Visual view to add a code chunk using the “Insert” &gt; “Executable Cell” option.\nJust like YAML is metadata for the Rmd document, code chunk options are metadata for the code chunk. Specify them within the {r} at the top of a code chunk, separated by commas. For a list of chunk options, check out Yihui Xie’s knitr book. Let’s try some:\n\nHide the code from the output with echo = FALSE.\nChange the figure width and height with fig.width = 5 and fig.height = 3.\nKnit the results. Can you spot the differences?",

    "text": "Tidy Data and the Tidyverse\nIn the last two weeks, we learned about the dplyr package for data manipulation and the ggplot2 package for graphing. These two packages are part of the “tidyverse”: a collection of data science packages that are designed to have input data frames and output data frames that are tidy. In fact, we can load all packages in the tidyverse at once with the single command library(tidyverse).\nHere, we are using the word “tidy” in a technical sense - we’re not talking about how “neat” or “organized” your data is. Instead, “tidy” is a very specific set of rules for storing data.\nTidy data is defined as data where\n\neach variables form a column,\neach observation forms a row, and\neach cell is a single measurement. [1]\n\nFor example, the following data set containing cat and dog names by family is not tidy. We have multiple observations per row (a cat, and a dog observation):\n\n\n\nOwner\nCat Name\nDog Name\n\n\n\n\nEmma\n\nMaud\n\n\nKevin\nMr. Meow\nBowser\n\n\nMargaret\nGoose\n\n\n\n\nInstead, a tidy version of this data set may look like this:\n\n\n\nPet Name\nType\nOwner\n\n\n\n\nMaud\nDog\nEmma\n\n\nMr. Meow\nCat\nKevin\n\n\nBowser\nDog\nKevin\n\n\nGoose\nCat\nMargaret\n\n\n\nEach row is an observation, each variable is a column, and each cell is a single measurement. Our data is tidy!\nAll of the data we used before this week were already tidy. This made it easy to use the tidyverse packages dplyr and ggplot2 to do what we needed to do. Oftentimes however, data is not collected in a tidy way. So, what happens do we do when we have untidy data? Let’s explore it!\n\nExample: Drinks\nThe fivethirtyeight R package contains a dataset called drinks. This dataset was compiled as part of a FiveThirtyEight article that explored (among other things) which countries consumes the most alcohol. Let’s look at a subset of the data:\n\n# install.packages(\"fivethirtyeight\") #uncomment if not installed\nlibrary(fivethirtyeight)\nlibrary(tibble)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\ndrinks_tbl1 &lt;- as_tibble(drinks) %&gt;% \n  select(-total_litres_of_pure_alcohol) #remove total liters variable\n\nhead(drinks_tbl1) #view the first few rows of the data\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 4\n  country           beer_servings spirit_servings wine_servings\n  &lt;chr&gt;                     &lt;int&gt;           &lt;int&gt;         &lt;int&gt;\n1 Afghanistan                   0               0             0\n2 Albania                      89             132            54\n3 Algeria                      25               0            14\n4 Andorra                     245             138           312\n5 Angola                      217              57            45\n6 Antigua & Barbuda           102             128            45\n\n\nThe following graphic was made from the drinks dataset.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt’s clear from the definition that tidiness is an attribute of a dataset. But did you know that tidiness also depends on what you are planning to do with the data? That’s because what’s an observation and what’s a variable depends on the data analysis plan!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 1\n\n\n\nWith a partner or a small group discuss the following questions think about if the data is tidy or untidy. If tidy, what would the ggplot code look like to reproduce this graph? If untidy, what would the tidy format look like? Sketch the first few rows of the data. Now, what would the ggplot code look like to reproduce this graph?"

    "section": "Basic Pivoting",
    "text": "Basic Pivoting\nOnce you have figured out what’s tidy for you, you may come to realize that your data is not tidy. As we have discussed, it will typically save you time and frustration to tidy it before moving on in your analysis.\nVery often this will involve using “pivoting” type functions. For example, the tidyr package in the tidyverse has two main pivoting functions:\n\npivot_longer() makes datasets longer: it moves some information in the columns into new rows, thereby increasing the number of rows of the dataset.\npivot_wider() makes datasets wider: it moves some information in the rows into new columns, thereby decreasing the number of rows of the dataset.\n\n\nPivoting Wider\nHere is an example of (artificial) data that is currently in “long” format, looking grades before and after active learning was incorporated into their math and science lectures:\n\ngrades_long &lt;- tibble(\n  student_id = c(1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2,2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3),\n  time = c(\"Before\", \"After\", \"Before\", \"After\", \"Before\", \"After\", \"Before\", \"After\", \"Before\", \"After\", \"Before\", \"After\"),\n  subject = c(\"Math\", \"Math\", \"Science\", \"Science\", \"Math\", \"Math\", \"Science\",\"Science\",  \"Math\", \"Math\", \"Science\", \"Science\"),\n  score = c(85, 86, 92, 92, 78, 82, 88, 89, 95, 94, 90, 90)\n)\n\nhead(grades_long)\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 4\n  student_id time   subject score\n       &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;  &lt;chr&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt;\n1          1 Before Math       85\n2          1 After  Math       86\n3          1 Before Science    92\n4          1 After  Science    92\n5          2 Before Math       78\n6          2 After  Math       82\n\n\nSometimes, we require data involving time to have row for each observation, and one column for each time point (i.e., wide data). While this isn’t our “standard” definition of tidy, sometimes this is what is required for longitudinal data (i.e., data involving measures repeated over time). Nevertheless, let’s try to pivot this table!\nWe can solve this problem using pivot_wider, which needs three pieces of information.\n\nWhat is a set of columns that uniquely identifies each observation? Put their names in the id_cols argument.\nWhere should the names for the new columns come from? Put the name of the column you want to take the new variable names from in the names_from argument.\nWhat values should the new columns contain? Put the name of the columns you want to take the values from to values_from in the values_from argument.\n\nNote that if you don’t specify an id_cols argument, pivot_wider will assume that you want it to be every column except those in names_from and values_from. Further, any columns not included in id_cols, names_from, and values_from (e.g., ep_id) will simply be dropped.\n\ngrades_wide &lt;- grades_long %&gt;% #assign new variable\n  pivot_wider(names_from=c(time), #get column names from time\n              values_from=c(score), #fill in values form score\n              names_prefix = \"Scores_\") #add \"scores_\" to new column names\n\nhead(grades_wide)\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 4\n  student_id subject Scores_Before Scores_After\n       &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;           &lt;dbl&gt;        &lt;dbl&gt;\n1          1 Math               85           86\n2          1 Science            92           92\n3          2 Math               78           82\n4          2 Science            88           89\n5          3 Math               95           94\n6          3 Science            90           90\n\n\n\n\nPivoting Longer\n\nThe Basics: Column Names Contain Variable Values\nHere is a snippet of WHO data on the number of tuberculosis cases in different years in different countries.\n\n\n# A tibble: 3 × 3\n  country     `1999` `2000`\n  &lt;chr&gt;        &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 Afghanistan    745   2666\n2 Brazil       37737  80488\n3 China       212258 213766\n\n\nIf we wanted to compare tuberculosis cases over time by country (e.g. by plotting the year on the x-axis and case count on the y-axis with a line for each country), then this format is not tidy. We want to (graphically) compare years within countries, so there should be one observation per unit within each population (country-years). In this case, we do not observe units within each country-year, so each observation is a country-year. The variables then fall into place: the country and year labels, and the case counts.\n(Aside: if we had measured more data, then perhaps there would be more units within each population! Imagine if we had case-level information, like severity. Then we could view cases as observations within the country-year populations, and we would have variables like country, year, case ID, and severity.)\nSo the tidy format here puts the variables (the year, the country, and the case counts) on the columns. There are 6 rows, one for each unique country-year combination. In this example, the tidy format is longer. That means to produce it using who_wide, we need to lengthen it by moving some information in the column names (the info about the measurement year) into new rows.\nWe can solve this problem using pivot_longer, which needs three pieces of information.\n\nWhich are the columns that we want to expand into more rows?

Then the most granular population we are trying to describe is a country, gender, age, and year combination, and like in the last example, we have no measured sub-units within that population, so an observation is a unique combination of country, gender, age, and year. (What a mouthful!)\nOnce we’ve sorted that out, the variables fall into place: country, year, gender, age range, and case count. Values for gender and age range are currently located in the column names of who_demo, and values for case count are currently spread across multiple columns. So to tidy who_demo up, we need to use pivot_longer() to move the info in the columns into new rows.\nConceptually, this is pretty similar to the last example: we want to use the information in m_014, m_1524, etc. to create new rows. So we should put those column names into the cols argument. But now, we want the information in their column names - the gender and age - to go into two new columns: gender and age. We can do this by specifying two column names in the names_to argument: gender and age.\nBut how is pivot_longer() to know which part of the column name m_014 corresponds to the gender, and which part corresponds to the age? You need to tell it that the pieces of information are separated by the “_” character using the names_sep argument.\nFinally, we can specify the name of the new column we want the values in the m_014, m_1524, etc. columns to go into with the values_to argument.\n\nwho_demo %&gt;% pivot_longer(cols = !(country:year), # all columns aside from country to year\n                          names_to = c(\"gender\", \"age\"), #new columns named age and gender\n                          names_sep = \"_\",#current gender and age are a single variable separated by _\n                          values_to = \"cases\") #use the cases column for the values\n\n# A tibble: 84 × 5\n   country      year gender age   cases\n   &lt;chr&gt;       &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;  &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1 Afghanistan  1999 m      014       8\n 2 Afghanistan  1999 m      1524     55\n 3 Afghanistan  1999 m      2534     55\n 4 Afghanistan  1999 m      3544     47\n 5 Afghanistan  1999 m      4554     34\n 6 Afghanistan  1999 m      5564     21\n 7 Afghanistan  1999 m      65        8\n 8 Afghanistan  1999 f      014      25\n 9 Afghanistan  1999 f      1524    139\n10 Afghanistan  1999 f      2534    160\n# ℹ 74 more rows\n\n\n\n\nExample: Column Names Contain Variable Names And Values\nSo far we have seen examples where the column names contain variable values. But what if they contain names AND values?\nLet’s have a look at the household dataset (loaded with the tidyr package), which has the date of birth and names of two children in families. Let’s say that we wanted to investigate how children names relate to their date of birth.\n\nhead(household)\n\n# A tibble: 5 × 5\n  family dob_child1 dob_child2 name_child1 name_child2\n   &lt;int&gt; &lt;date&gt;     &lt;date&gt;     &lt;chr&gt;       &lt;chr&gt;      \n1      1 1998-11-26 2000-01-29 Susan       Jose       \n2      2 1996-06-22 NA         Mark        &lt;NA&gt;       \n3      3 2002-07-11 2004-04-05 Sam         Seth       \n4      4 2004-10-10 2009-08-27 Craig       Khai       \n5      5 2000-12-05 2005-02-28 Parker      Gracie     \n\n\nWe are trying to learn about the population from which these children belong; it is hard to say precisely what that is without having more information about how this data was collected, but it is likely something like “all children living in a particular place in a particular year”. The units in this population are children. So to tidy this data, we’d want “date of birth” and “name” to be two variables/columns associated with an observation/row (a child). We know we want to use pivot_longer(), because we want to make household longer by creating new variables. But wait! The names of the “date of birth”/“name” variables AND the values of the “child” variable are BOTH in the column names of household!\nInspecting the documentation for pivot_longer() very carefully reveals that you can use a special specification of the names_to argument to resolve this problem.\n\nhousehold %&gt;% pivot_longer(cols = -family, # all columns except family\n                           names_to = c(\".value\", \"child\"), #change column names, .value is a placeholder\n                           names_sep = \"_\") # dob and child are currently separated by _ in one single variable\n\n# A tibble: 10 × 4\n   family child  dob        name  \n    &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt;  &lt;date&gt;     &lt;chr&gt; \n 1      1 child1 1998-11-26 Susan \n 2      1 child2 2000-01-29 Jose  \n 3      2 child1 1996-06-22 Mark  \n 4      2 child2 NA         &lt;NA&gt;  \n 5      3 child1 2002-07-11 Sam   \n 6      3 child2 2004-04-05 Seth  \n 7      4 child1 2004-10-10 Craig \n 8      4 child2 2009-08-27 Khai  \n 9      5 child1 2000-12-05 Parker\n10      5 child2 2005-02-28 Gracie\n\n\nThe special \".value\" specification says that we want to use the first component of the pivoted column name as a variable name, and make a new column with values coming from the second component of the pivoted column name. The second thing we pass into names_to names that new column.\nThis process is best described by Figure 6.7 from R4DS.\nBut wait! Row 4 is a bunch of NAs! Does that mean this data isn’t tidy??\nThe fact that there is an NA does not necessarily mean that this data is untidy. To be clear: for the purpose of the tidy data definition, an indicator for a missing value is a value.\nWhether this data is untidy depends on the data context. Essentially, the question we should ask is: “Is row 4 an observation that we are missing information about? Or is it simply an artifact of our pivoting procedure?”\nSuppose this study was designed to only sample families with two children. Then, row 4 could be a real observation that we are missing information about: family 2 should have only been included if they had two children. Perhaps this reflects family 2 filling out a survey that asks them the number of children (in which they listed 2), but then getting distracted and forgetting to fill out the information for their second child. In this case, our data is tidy, and the tidy data format is a real advantage: it reveals missing information in our data set that was not obvious from the original untidy format.\nNow suppose this study just samples families at large. We know from experience about the world that some families have one children, some families have two, and some families have more. Then, it seems possible that row 4 is not a real observation: family 2 might just have a single child. In this case, we have a row for something that is not an observation, so we would like to tidy up by dropping it. We could actually have done this by altering our original pivot_wider() call as follows:\n\nhousehold %&gt;% pivot_longer(cols = -family, \n                           names_to = c(\".value\", \"child\"), \n                           names_sep = \"_\", \n                           values_drop_na = TRUE) #remove NAs\n\n# A tibble: 9 × 4\n  family child  dob        name  \n   &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt;  &lt;date&gt;     &lt;chr&gt; \n1      1 child1 1998-11-26 Susan \n2      1 child2 2000-01-29 Jose  \n3      2 child1 1996-06-22 Mark  \n4      3 child1 2002-07-11 Sam   \n5      3 child2 2004-04-05 Seth  \n6      4 child1 2004-10-10 Craig \n7      4 child2 2009-08-27 Khai  \n8      5 child1 2000-12-05 Parker\n9      5 child2 2005-02-28 Gracie\n\n\nThis discussion highlights the importance of knowing the context in which your data is collected for tidying (and for your analysis at large). Here and elsewhere, it really pays to be in close contact with the people who generated your data."

    "text": "Separating and Uniting\nThe tidyr package has a function for gluing columns together (unite) and for cutting columns apart (separate). Why might this help us tidy?

We would like to snip it apart at the “/” character to create two columns:\n\ntable5 &lt;- table3 %&gt;% separate(col = rate, \n                    into = c(\"cases\", \"population\"))\ntable5\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 4\n  country      year cases  population\n  &lt;chr&gt;       &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;  &lt;chr&gt;     \n1 Afghanistan  1999 745    19987071  \n2 Afghanistan  2000 2666   20595360  \n3 Brazil       1999 37737  172006362 \n4 Brazil       2000 80488  174504898 \n5 China        1999 212258 1272915272\n6 China        2000 213766 1280428583\n\n\nThe col argument specifies the column we want to separate, and the into argument specifies the names of the new columns. The sep argument (not specified here) specifies where we want to cut. The default is pretty clever - it separates at any non-alphanumeric value. (How this is accomplished involves regular expressions, which are very useful when working with character data. We will learn more about regular expressions in STAT 545B. )"

See Untidy Data: The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Tables.\nWe could lose important information about the context in which the data was collected by cleaning and tidying raw data. This can have important ethical implications; see Chapter 5 of the book “Data Feminism” by Catherine D’Ignazio and Lauren F.

    "text": "Get Acquainted with Git and GitHub\n“Git” is a version control system designed to track changes. This is what GitHub uses! Git essentially creates “snapshots” of your work as you progress through a project.\n\nRepositories, Organizations, and Personal Accounts\nA repository stores files and the history of the files; the usual convention is to use a single repository to organize a single project.\nGitHub is a place where repositories can live online. Being online provides us a way to share and collaborate on projects. It also serves as a backup for your project.\nExample 1: Grace’s GitHub page\nExample 1: The STAT 545 GitHub page\nThe first repository lives under Grace’s personal Github account. The second repository lives under the UBC-STAT organization. Organizations are useful if you have lots of different projects with a common theme which lots of people are collaborating on.\nWe can interact with and send data between GitHub and RStudio using Git.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGit States and Lingo\nTo use Git, we should first understand the primary states that files can be in. These are:\n\nModified: you’ve changed something in the files, but Git hasn’t accounted for them yet.\nStaged: Git has tracked the changes you’ve made, but they haven’t been accounted for in the latest snapshot of your work.\nCommitted: the changes you’ve made have been stored and updated as the latest snapshot of your project.\n\nAfter changes are committed locally (on your computer), we can push them to a GitHub repository. This sends the changes and updates the most recent version of your project on GitHub. We can also pull changes from GitHub to your local machine. This is useful when multiple people (or perhaps one person on multiple devices) are working on a project.\nOther useful Git features include:\n\nCloning a repository: copying an existing GitHub repository to your local machine. You can push and pull changes after cloning.\nUsing Branches: creating a separate line of development within your repository, allowing for isolated work on new features. This is a safe way to ensure you aren’t overwriting the main repository branch. Branches can be merged together later in development\nPull Requests: Git’s way of proposing changes to the repository’s main branch.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 1\n\n\n\nGo to your GitHub profile (mine is https://github.com/grcetmpk)\nCreate a new GitHub repository by clicking the + symbol in the top bar and using the dropdown menu to create a new repository.\nName your repository stat-545-demo-YOUR-NAME. In the description write “STAT 545 Demo”. Check the box for adding a README file.\nYou are now redirected to the repository main page. The repository page tells you you have 1 commit. Click on it to get to the history page. This tells you all the changes that have been tracked for the files in the repository so far.\nGo back to your repository main page. Click on README.md, then click the pencil icon (“Edit this file”_. Add the following information into the README.md file:\n\nYour Name\nYour Program\n\nCommit your changes: click the commit changes button, and briefly summarize the changes you’ve made in the Commit message.\nCheck out the Github commit history again.

You will now see at the top of RStudio that the name of your project is displayed.\nTo add a new R Script to your R Project, go to “File” &gt; “New File” &gt; “R Script”. Write your code. “File” &gt; “Save as” and name your file and ensure it’s saved in your project folder. Let’s add one called analysis.R with some simple code:\n# view the first few rows of mtcars dataset\nhead(mtcars)\n\n# calculate the average mpg among all cars, save it as a variable\nmean_mpg &lt;- mean(mtcars$mpg)\n\n# print the mean mpg\nmean_mpg\nAfter running this code, you’ll notice mean_mpg is in your environment. The cool thing about R Projects is that the next time you open your project, you’ll continue exactly where you’re left off! All variables you created will have been saved, as if you never closed R Studio.\nYou can add multiple files to projects, and save things like images/pdfs of plots, multiple R Scripts (code), and data sets. Really, anything that you can save in the R Project folder will be contained in the R Project.\n\n\nCreate a GitHub Repository for your Existing (Local) R Project\nSyncing your R Project to GitHub is a smart idea! You can work on the project on multiple machines, back up your work, see previous versions of your work, and collaborate easily with others.\nIn this lecture, we will assume an R Project already exists and we want to create a new GitHub repository for it. Previously, we created an R Project “STAT545_Example_Project” with the R Script analysis.R. Let’s sync this project to GitHub!\n\nIn the R Console, load in the usethis package by calling library(usethis)\nIn the R Console, call use_git(). When asked if it’s okay to commit some changes, select an option that means yes (it could be “OK” or “For sure” or “Yes”, for example) by writing the number in the console and hitting Enter. If it prompts you to restart RStudio, you can do so.\nIf you restarted RStudio, call library(usethis) again. Then, in the Console call use_github(). A new repository on your GitHub account should be created! You should see your code analysis.R as one of the items in your repository.\n\nIf you have issues, see the last section of Lecture 1A: Installation to set up your GitHub credentials on RStudio.\n\n\nClone a GitHub Repository (GitHub Repository Already Exists Remotely)\nWhat if you want to use an existing R Project that is on GitHub in a repository? We can clone it!\n\nIn RStudio, go to “File &gt; New Project”\nClick on “Version Control: Checkout a project from a version control repository”\nClick on “Git: Clone a project from a repository”\nFill in the info: URL: use HTTPS address (found on GitHub when clicking the green “Code” button) Create as a subdirectory of: Browse to where you would like to save this repository on your machine (creates a new folder in the location you select)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow you have a local version of this project! You can interact with it using the instructions in the following section.\nSide note: you can clone any public project, however you need to be added as a collaborator to push those changes to GitHub. If you’d like to play around with existing repositories, you could “Fork” it. A fork is a copy of a repository. Forking a repository allows you to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original project.

    "text": "Syncing Your R Project with GitHub\nYou’ve created a repository for your R Project - but what happens when we edit our project on our computer? Well, we need to send those changes to our GitHub repository (it’s not automatic).\nLet’s make some changes to our STAT545_Example_Project! Adding a README file could be a nice addition. Whatever is written in this file will appear on the home page of our repository and can provide useful information about our repository.\nLet’s create an Markdown (NOT RMARKDOWN!) document called “README.md” (“File” &gt; “New File” &gt; “Markdown File”). Set the title to “README”.\nLet’s add the following to the file:\n## STAT545 Example Project\n\nThis is my first R Project, synced to GitHub! It follows the lecture notes at &lt;https://ubc-stat.github.io/STAT545.github.io/webpages/lectures_i/lec2b_versioncontrol.html&gt;\n\nSave this file as “README.md”.\nLet’s also change something in our analysis.R file. Let’s add the following to our file:\n# plot wt vs mpg\nplot(mtcars$wt, mtcars$mpg)\nSave the changes.\nNow, there are two ways that I’ll show you how to interact with GitHub through RStudio.\n\nUsing RStudio’s “Git” Tab\nUsing the Terminal\n(Secret third option: using GitHub Desktop. I won’t show this in detail but it is an option!)\n\n\nFrom RStudio’s “Git” Tab\nWhen you navigate to the “Git” tab in RStudio, you will see that README.Rmd and analysis.R are listed. This is because these files have changes! README.Rmd was added, and analysis.R was modified.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe need to stage the files, commit the changes, and then push the changes to the remote GitHub version.\n\nStage Files: Select the files you want to stage by selecting them. You will see symbols beside them - “A” stands for “Added” and “M” stands for “modified”. If you were to delete a file, you would see a red “D”.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCommit Changes: Click the Commit button. In the pop-up, you can scan through and see the changes (additions, deletions, modifications) for each file that has been staged in Step 1. Add a message explaining the changes, and click Commit. You will get a message that says 2 files have changed. Close this.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPush: You now have nothing to commit, as all changes have been tracked. You will see an information message saying “Your branch is ahead of”origin/main” by 1 commit. Time to Push! Click the Push button. If successful, the following message will appear:\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt; /usr/bin/git push origin HEAD:refs/heads/main\nTo https://github.com/&lt;yourGitHubusername/STAT545_Example_Project.git\n   37b4ec8..7b32df4  HEAD -&gt; main\nClose this pop-up, and the “GitHub interface.”Review Changes” pop-up.\nNow, when you go to your GitHub account, you should see some changes to your STAT545_Example_Project repository! You can see when the changes were pushed, and now a README appears below the files!\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can also Pull from the repository using the “Pull” button on the Git pane. This allows us to sync changes that are in our GitHub repository but not on out local machine (yet!). Simply use the “Pull” button in the Git pane on RStudio.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom RStudio’s Terminal\nInstead of using the Git pane, we can write out commands for Git in the Terminal.\n\nStage Changes: git add . stages all of your modified files (can also just name the files you want to commit instead of using .)\nCommit Changes: git commit -m \"some message\" commits your changes, along with a message summarizing the changes\nPush Changes: git push origin main pushes your changes to the GitHub repo (main branch, which is typically the default)\n\nOther useful Terminal commands include:\n\ngit status: see which of your changes have been tracked, staged, and committed\ngit checkout: see what branch you’re on, or change branches\ngit pull: pull changes from the remote repository (GitHub) to your local computer",

    "text": "More on Git\n\nBranches\nBranches allow for parallel development within a repository. Branches are also a safe way to test out new features, fix bugs, or experiment with new ideas.\nWhen creating a repository, a default branch is created. This is typically named “main” (or in older repositories, “master”). The default branch is the branch that GitHub displays when anyone visits your repository. The default branch is also the initial branch that Git checks out locally when someone clones the repository. Unless you specify a different branch, the default branch in a repository is the base branch for new pull requests and code commits.\nTo create a new branch, you can either navigate to the Git pane and click the icon with two purple rectangles connected to a white diamond. Here, you can create a new branch and name it. Then, you can switch between branches using the drop down menu beside it (see below).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can make changes on your new branch, and push them to GitHub.\n\nNOTE: if using Terminal, you can create a new branch using git checkout -b &lt;new-branch-name&gt; and switch branches using git checkout &lt;new-branch-name&gt;. You can push changes to the new branch using git push origin &lt;new-branch-name&gt;, where &lt;new-branch-name&gt; is the name of your branch)\n\nAfter pushing changes to a branch, you will see a message on GitHub.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf this message does not appear, click “main” and switch the branch to the new one you just made. You will see a message that says “this branch is one commit ahead of main”). Click that message.\n\nClick “Compare and pull request”. Here, you can see the changes between the main and new branch.\nIf you’re satisfied with the changes, you can click “Create pull request” to begin the merge the changes from your new branch to main.\nIf no conflicts exist, click “Merge pull request”. Now, the changes will be on the main (default) branch!\nClick “Confirm merge”.\n\n\n\nMerging Conflicts\nMerge conflicts happen when we’ve created multiple versions of files that can’t be obviously combined into one definitive version.\nHere is an example of something that would not cause a merge conflict:\n\nAt 9am, my TA pulls from the STAT 545 repository, makes a local change to the course dashboard, and commits and pushes her changes.\nAt 10am, I forget to pull from the STAT 545 repository, and start working on the Day 1 notes locally.\nWhen I commit and push, Git is a bit confused, because I wasn’t working off of the “freshest” version of the STAT 545 repository - but since my TA and I were working on different lines of code, it will fairly seamlessly figure out that the right thing to do is to add my changes to the Day 1 notes to the current version of the STAT 545 repository online.\n\nHere is an example of something that WOULD cause a merge conflict:\n\nAt 9am, my TA and I both pull from the STAT 545 repository.\nAt 10am, my TA changes the front page to say “STAT 555 @ UBC”, and commits/pushes those changes.\nAt 11am, I change the front page (without pulling!!!) to say “STAT 777 @ UBC”.\nWhen I commit and push, Git doesn’t know what to do. Should it make the version that says “STAT 555 @ UBC” or “STAT 777 @ UBC” the definitive version? The push will fail, and Git will tell us we need to fix the conflict and then commit the result.\n\nHow do we fix this?\n\nPull.\nOpen the file that caused the merge conflict. You should see something like this:\n\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; HEAD\nSTAT 555 @ UBC\n=======\nSTAT 777 @ UBC\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 526363991d21ed20e7e0c57b5e99d944ac5ce5aa\n\nThe stuff below the &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; and above the ======= is what was in your local version; the stuff above the &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and below the ======= is what was in the remote conflicting version. Decide what you want to have on the offending line (e.g. “STAT 555 @ UBC”), and replace the whole block of text above with that.\nSave and commit the file. (An informative message here might be “Fixing a merge conflict.”) You should now be able to successfully push!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise\n\n\n\nFind a partner. In this exercise, we will learn how to have different team members save their work separately on branches, and how to merge those changes to the main project branch.\n\nTeammate A adds Teammate B to their “stat545-demo” repository as a collaborator. (Go to Settings from the main repo page, then Access &gt; Collaborators). This should send Teammate B an email with a collaboration invitation; accept that invitation.\nTeammate B clones Teammate A’s “stat545-demo” repository.\nOn their own computer, Teammate B will make a new branch in Teammate A’s stat545-demo repository. You can do this either on Github by clicking on “1 branch” on the repo homepage then the green “New branch” button, or on your own computer in R Studio with the “New Branch” button.\nOn their own computer, Teammate B will create a new file in the newly created branch, then commit and push it.\nTeammate B will start a pull request (basically a request to merge content onto the main branch) on GitHub, by going to “Pull Requests” -&gt; “New Pull Request”, and selecting the branch you intend to merge to the main branch. In this pull request, include a comment and title indicating (at a high level) what the change made is about.\nTeammate A will follow the instructions here to merge the pull request.\n\n\n\n\n\nOther Tips\n\nCommit changes OFTEN! Commit them as often as you would save your work!\nBe careful when working with data containing personal identifying information (PII). This should NOT be stored on GitHub.\nAll of your projects in this class will live in the STAT 545 @ UBC Organization.\nWhen you watch a Github repo, you get notifications when things happen in them. So if you “Watch” the STAT 545 webpage repo, then you will get email notifications when I update the site!",

Whether you’re a student enrolled in STAT 545 or simply someone looking to learn how to write reproducible and collaborative data analyses, it is our hope that this website will serve as a great resource for learning these new skills!\nIn short, this course will enable you to confidently write clean and modern data analyses in R using version control software (GitHub), and creating reports using R Markdown. The primary focus will be on using these technologies to conduct analyses with daily workflow, rather than the statistical theory and methods for analysis.\nThis course is divided into two parts. In Part I (STAT545 A), we will introduce\n\nR and RStudio,\nReport generation with R Markdown,\nProject organization, workflow, and coding style,\nData management with dataframes and tibbles using tidyverse,\nData visualization with ggplot2, and\nVersion control using Git and Github.\n\nIn Part II (STAT545 B), we will dive deeper into\n\nWriting functions in R,\nAdvanced computations on data,\nFunctional programming with purrr,\nR packages,\nInteractive pages, apps, and graphics with RShiny, and\nWebsite development using Quarto.\n\nIf you are a student enrolling in this course for credit at UBC, you MUST take STAT 545 A to enroll in STAT545 B. There are no exceptions to this rule."

    "text": "Getting Familiar with R\n\n1.1 Calculator\nIn its simplest form, R can be used as a interactive calculator.\n\n10 + 4 # you can add \n10 - 4 # subtract\n4 / 2 # divide\n2 * 5 # multiply\n3 ^ 4 # and exponentiate\n\nNow, what if you need to compute a longer expression? Let’s say that I want to find out the percentage of students in the STAT department that are taking STAT545A (note: these numbers are fictional!). I could compute this in several steps, or use a more complex expression.\nUsing multiple steps…\n\nTo calculate the number of students in the STAT department, I add 375 new students that have enrolled this year, to the 2000 that were already enrolled.\n\n\n2000 + 375\n\n\nThere are 82 students taking STAT545A this year. Last year, there was the same number of students, but 3 dropped the course after the first two weeks. Let’s hypothesise that only 1 will drop the course this year - although I hope the real number is 0 :)\n\n\n82 - 1\n\n\nWith the number of students taking STAT545 this year (hypothetically), and the number of students currently in the STAT department, I can now calculate what percentage of students in the STAT department are taking this class.\n\n\n81 / 2375\n\n\n0.03410526 * 100\n\nWhat if we use a single expression?\nIt seems that around 3% of students in the STAT department are taking STAT545A… but that took a lot of steps to calculate. We could also write it like this to save some time:\n\n(82 - 1) / (2000 + 375) * 100 \n\nAs you can see, taking care of precedence rules (i.e. using brackets appropriately), we can save some time by writing a single expression.\nYour turn! Can you calculate the percentage of your life that you have spent in university?\nCompute the difference between 2020 and the year that you started university, and divide this by the difference between 2020 and the year that you were born. Multiply this with 100 to get the percentage of your life that you have spent in university. Your challenge here is to use a single expression.\n\n# your code here\n\n\n\n1.2 Variables\nAlright, R as a calculator works just fine… but you don’t learn a programming language only to compute arithmetic expressions. What if you want to use your result from above in a second calculation? Instead of retyping your expression every time that you need it, or copying and pasting the result, you can simply create a new variable that stores it.\nEarlier, I figured out that I had spent 18% of my life at university. I want to assign this value to a variable called life_university, which will help me remember what my value means. The way you assign a value to a variable in R is by using the assignment operator, which is just a “less than” symbol, followed by a minus sign. It looks like this:\n\nlife_university &lt;- 18\n\nNow, the variable life_university, stores the value 18, which is the percentage of time that I had spent at university. But prior to saving this into a variable, I had to calculate the value separately. What if I directly assigned the arithmetic expression that I used to compute my value to the variable?\n\nlife_university &lt;- (2025 - 2016) / (2025 - 1997) * 100\n\nNotice that R did not print the result of my expression this time. When you use the assignment operator, R assumes that you don’t want to see the result immediately, but rather that you intend to use it for something else later on.\nTo view the contents of the variable, you simply have to type the name of the variable - in this case, life_university and press Enter. Try it below!\n\n# your code here\n\nQUESTION 1.0\n{points: 1}\nNow, it’s your turn to store the percentage of time that you have spent at university into a variable - try typing the arithmetic expression that you used to compute that value, rather than the value itself! Name this variable my_life_university in the first cell below, and check whether the answer is acceptable by running the second cell below. If the test cell gives you an error, try a different answer!\nmy_life_university &lt;- FILL_THIS_IN / FILL_THIS_IN * 100\n\n# your code here\nfail() # No Answer - remove if you provide an answer\n\n\nlibrary(digest)\nstopifnot(\"type of (my_life_university &gt; 1 && my_life_university &lt; 100) is not logical\"= setequal(digest(paste(toString(class((my_life_university &gt; 1 && my_life_university &lt; 100))), \"45407\")), \"8ef3d130be9b82df017f19a19f8a701f\"))\nstopifnot(\"logical value of (my_life_university &gt; 1 && my_life_university &lt; 100) is not correct\"= setequal(digest(paste(toString((my_life_university &gt; 1 && my_life_university &lt; 100)), \"45407\")), \"3b1208e2956a9eb53b1440cd65070794\"))\n\nprint('Success!')\n\n\n\n1.3 Data structures\nAny object that contains data is called a data structure.\n\n\n1.3.1 Vectors\n\nNumeric vectors\nSo far, you’ve learned how to use R as a calculator, and how to use variables to store numeric values. But in reality, a “variable” in R is just a way to name your data so that R can recall it later. Think of it as a label that you put on a box, so that you remember the contents that are inside it.\nThe variable that you created above, my_life_university, stores the most basic data structure in R programming language: a vector. Even a single number is considered a vector of length one, which is the case with the vector that was assigned to my_life_university. Let’s have a look again:\n\nmy_life_university\n\nIn this way, you can think of the vector as the data structure, and the variable as a label. But what if you want a vector that’s greater than length one, or in other words, that stores more than a single numeric value? The easiest way to create a vector is using c(), which stands for “concatenate”, or “combine”.\nQUESTION 1.1\n{points: 1}\nLet’s give it a try. To create a vector containing the numbers 3.14, 2.71, and 6.28, type c(3.14, 2.71, 6.28).

You’ve created your first logical vector. Logical vectors can contain the values TRUE, FALSE, and NA (for ‘not available’ - this happens when you have missing data!). These values are generated as the result of logical ‘conditions’. We have seen the logical operator “greater than” in this activity, but there are many more, such as “less than”, “exactly equal to”, or “not equal to”. Don’t worry, there will be plenty of time to use those in the future!\n\n\n…and more\nThere are other types of vectors out there in the R universe, such as character vectors. We won’t get into the nitty gritty of these - logical and numeric are the most basic R vectors, the ones that you absolutely need to know & that we will use most often. However, we didn’t want to leave you in the dark about these other types of vectors! If you really, really want to know more, you can read more about vectors here.\nAnyway, here is a handy tip! If you ever come across a vector and you’re not sure what it is, you can inspect its two key properties: type, and length. Here is an example of how you would do it. “Double” is just a type of numeric vector.\n\ntypeof(x)\nlength(x)\n\n\n\n\n1.3.2 Dataframes\nLiving in a vector-only world would be nice if all data analyses involved one variable. When we have more than one variable, data frames come to the rescue. Basically, a data frame holds data in tabular format. R has some data frames “built in”. For example, motor car data is attached to the variable name mtcars.\nPrint mtcars to screen. If I haven’t mentioned before, “print” means to type the name of the object, and press Enter – which is the same as surrounding the object with the print() function. Notice the tabular format.\n\nmtcars\nprint(mtcars)\n\nWe will talk more about dataframes in just a bit, but for now, just keep in mind that they are one of the most used data structures in R - albeit more complex than vectors.\n\n\n1.4 Subsetting\nOften, when you’re working with a large dataset (such as mtcars), you will only be interested in a small portion of it. Even when working with a simpler data structure, such as vectors, you may want to extract a particular value that you are interested in. R has several ways of doing this, in a process that it calls “subsetting”. Subsetting dataframes is definitely a more complex task - we will start little, with vectors.\nA student from a previous STAT545 cohort tracked his commute times for two weeks (10 days), and saved them in a vector that he stored in the variable times. Here is the times variable.\n\ntimes &lt;- c(18, 22, 43, 26, 75, 31, 32, 17, 16, 51)\n\nWe use [] to subset the vector of times. Although we had a look at this in class, here are a couple examples to refresh your memory. To extract the first entry of a vector:\n\nx[1]\n\nAnd if I want to extract everything but the first entry:\n\nx[-1]\n\nYou’re doing a great job! Now, it’s your turn to use [] to subset the vector of times.

Let’s explore a few basic functions just for fun. Type Sys.Date() below to see what happens!\n\n# your code here\n\nRemember that there are different types of vectors, besides numeric and logical? Well, the output of Sys.Date() is actually an example of another vector type, known in R language as a “string”. A “string” is just a character (any value written within a pair of single or double quotes in R) variable that contains one or more characters!\nThe value that Sys.Date() computes is based on your computer’s environment, but functions in R can also manipulate input data in order to compute a return value. At the start of this worksheet, you were introduced to the simplest form of R - as a calculator. Actually, R functions allow us to compute certain things that could be done manually as a calculator, but much faster.\nRecall the times vector earlier. What’s the average travel time? Instead of computing this manually, we can use a function called mean.\n\nmean(times)\n\nNotice the syntax of using a function: starting by the left with the function name, and the input goes inside brackets. We input times, and we got an output. Did this function change the input? Check:\nQUESTION 1.15\n{points: 1}\nAside from bizarre functions, this is always the case. But functions don’t always return a single value. Try the range() function (assigning the result to answer1.15a), and the sqrt() function (assigning the result to answer1.15b), using the times vector as an argument for both.\nanswer1.15a &lt;- FILL_THIS_IN(FILL_THIS_IN)\nanswer1.15b &lt;- FILL_THIS_IN(FILL_THIS_IN)\n\n# your code here\nfail() # No Answer - remove if you provide an answer\n\n\nlibrary(digest)\nstopifnot(\"type of answer1.15a is not numeric\"= setequal(digest(paste(toString(class(answer1.15a)), \"4f773\")), \"e787fa61d7383b8972fdbe98990945fd\"))\nstopifnot(\"value of answer1.15a is not correct (rounded to 2 decimal places)\"= setequal(digest(paste(toString(round(answer1.15a, 2)), \"4f773\")), \"38821b86c39bdad4b6f1a3496a92e626\"))\nstopifnot(\"length of answer1.15a is not correct\"= setequal(digest(paste(toString(length(answer1.15a)), \"4f773\")), \"6d26d981dcaf87c5bab77b87ebab719e\"))\nstopifnot(\"values of answer1.15a are not correct\"= setequal(digest(paste(toString(sort(round(answer1.15a, 2))), \"4f773\")), \"38821b86c39bdad4b6f1a3496a92e626\"))\n\nstopifnot(\"type of answer1.15b is not numeric\"= setequal(digest(paste(toString(class(answer1.15b)), \"4f774\")), \"fa3cdfdca72f9dcdda19da090216fba1\"))\nstopifnot(\"value of answer1.15b is not correct (rounded to 2 decimal places)\"= setequal(digest(paste(toString(round(answer1.15b, 2)), \"4f774\")), \"64e97708108935269d1892485220b180\"))\nstopifnot(\"length of answer1.15b is not correct\"= setequal(digest(paste(toString(length(answer1.15b)), \"4f774\")), \"b4bba74991df15bdffddef237b578794\"))\nstopifnot(\"values of answer1.15b are not correct\"= setequal(digest(paste(toString(sort(round(answer1.15b, 2))), \"4f774\")), \"61f4ceeb0021959e7fb4a20676ac1749\"))\n\nprint('Success!')\n\nFunctions can also take more than one argument as input, separated by commas. You can find out what these arguments are by accessing the function’s documentation, which you can do by executing ?\"function name\". Try accessing the documentation of the mean() function by executing ?mean.\n\n# your code here\n\nThere are four arguments. All the arguments have names, except for the ... argument (more on ... – ellipses – later). This is always the case.\nUnder “Usage”, some of the arguments are of the form name = value. These are default values, in case you don’t specify these arguments. This is a sure sign that these arguments are optional.\nx is “on its own”. This typically means that it has no default, and often (but not always) means that the argument is required. We can specify an argument in one of two ways:\n\nspecifying argument name = value in the function parentheses; or\nmatching the ordering of the input with the ordering of the arguments.\n\nFor readability, this is not recommended beyond the first or sometimes second argument!\nQUESTION 1.16\n{points: 1}\nTry executing mean() again with times as an argument, but this time, set the na.rm to TRUE.

    "text": "Exercise 1: Exploring with select() and filter()\nMovieLens are a series of datasets widely used in education, that describe movie ratings from the MovieLens website. There are several MovieLens datasets, collected by the GroupLens Research Project at the University of Minnesota. Here, we load the MovieLens 100K dataset from Rafael Irizarry and Amy Gill’s R package, dslabs, which contains datasets useful for data analysis practice, homework, and projects in data science courses and workshops.

Here’s one suggestion, though you don’t have to take it: make a plot with two panels, one that has a scatterplot of height versus age for the female patients, and one that has a scatterplot of height versus age for the male patients.\n\nggplot(fev_tbl, aes(x = age, y = height, colour=sex)) + \n  geom_jitter(width=0.2, alpha = 0.75) + \n  scale_colour_manual(values=c(\"cornflowerblue\",\"darkorange\")) + \n  facet_wrap(~sex) + \n  ggtitle(\"Height versus age, stratified by sex\") +\n  xlab(\"Age\") + \n  ylab(\"Height (inches)\") + \n  theme_bw()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe see that the within-sex trend is similar: height is linear-ish at younger ages, and flat-ish at older ages.

Let’s be careful to get the timezone right too, in case it turns out to be important later.\n\n(new_sched_dep_time &lt;- mdy_hm(\"Oct 1 2013 9:00\", tz = \"America/New_York\"))\n\n[1] \"2013-10-01 09:00:00 EDT\"\n\n\nNow let’s make a 1-row tibble with the components we need: year, month, day, hour, minute, carrier, and flight code. The key will be the year(), month(), etc. functions from the lubridate package.\n\n(new_flight &lt;- tribble(~year, ~month, ~day, ~hour, ~minute, ~flight, ~carrier, \n                      year(new_sched_dep_time), month(new_sched_dep_time), \n                      day(new_sched_dep_time), hour(new_sched_dep_time), \n                      minute(new_sched_dep_time), 123, \"AC\"))\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 7\n   year month   day  hour minute flight carrier\n  &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt;  &lt;int&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;  \n1  2013    10     1     9      0    123 AC     \n\n\nLike magic!!!

How was this variable made?\nLet’s see one way how. Let’s make two Date-Time objects corresponding to the departure and scheduled departure of our fake flight. If we subtract them, then we get a difftime object.\n\nnew_sched_dep_time &lt;- ymd_hm(\"2013 October 1 9:00\", tz = \"America/New_York\")\nnew_dep_time &lt;- ymd_hm(\"2013 Oct 1 9:15\", tz = \"America/New_York\")\n\nnew_dep_time - new_sched_dep_time \n\nTime difference of 15 mins\n\n\nBeautiful! In this case, this calculation was easy to do by hand, but it would’ve been more annoying if we were calculating the time elapsed between (say) December 11th 2010 3:17am and March 24th 2011 11:51pm.\ndifftime objects produce human readable output, but can be a little annoying when you want output in consistent units. duration objects to the rescue - they always use seconds! Let’s do the math again but this time coerce the result to a duration object.\n\n(duration_delay &lt;- as.duration(new_dep_time - new_sched_dep_time))\n\n[1] \"900s (~15 minutes)\"\n\n\nFinally we can convert this to minutes by creating a duration object that spans a minute using the convenience function dminutes(), and doing date-time division.\n\nduration_delay/dminutes(1)\n\n[1] 15"

    "text": "The fev data set\nIt is now widely believed that smoking tends to impair lung function. Much of the data to support this claim arises from studies of pulmonary function in adults who are long-time smokers. A question then arises whether such deleterious effects of smoking can be detected in children who smoke. To address this question, measures of lung function were made in about 600 children seen for a routine check up in a particular pediatric clinic. The children participating in this study were asked whether they were current smokers.\nA common measurement of lung function is the forced expiratory volume (FEV), which measures how much air you can blow out of your lungs in a short period of time. A higher FEV is usually associated with better respiratory function. It is well known that prolonged smoking diminishes FEV in adults, and those adults with diminished FEV also tend to have decreased pulmonary function as measured by other clinical variables, such as blood oxygen and carbon dioxide levels.\nData collected from the study on the relationship between smoking status and lung function (measured by FEV) in children are contained in the fev_tbl dataset.

In fact, let’s break it down by sex, and calculate the proportion of girls who are smokers and the proportion of boys who are smokers, as well as the number of girls and the number of boys in the study.\n\nfev_tbl %&gt;% group_by(sex) %&gt;% \n            summarize(prop_smoke = mean(smoke == \"yes\"), \n                      n = n())\n\n# A tibble: 2 × 3\n  sex    prop_smoke     n\n  &lt;fct&gt;       &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;int&gt;\n1 female     0.123    318\n2 male       0.0774   336\n\n\nThe proportion of girls who are smokers is higher than the proportion of boys that are smokers.\n\n\nExercise 7\nIs this because there are more smokers among teenage girls than teenage boys? Or is this a phenomenon that is uniform across age groups? To find out, let’s calculate:\n\nthe proportion and number of girls aged 0-6 who are smokers\nthe proportion and number of girls aged 7-12 who are smokers\nthe proportion and number of girls aged 13-19 who are smokers\nthe proportion and number of boys aged 0-6 who are smokers\nthe proportion and number of boys aged 7-12 who are smokers\nthe proportion and number of boys aged 13-19 who are smokers\n\nHint: you will need to create a new variable that has three categories: age 0-6, age 7-12, and age 13-19. You can do so with fev_tbl %&gt;% mutate(age_cat = cut(age, c(0, 6, 12, 19))).\n\nfev_tbl %&gt;% mutate(age_cat = cut(age, c(0, 6, 12, 19))) %&gt;% \n  group_by(age_cat, sex) %&gt;% \n  summarize(prop_smoke=mean(smoke == \"yes\"), n=n())\n\n`summarise()` has grouped output by 'age_cat'.

    "text": "The fev data set\nIt is now widely believed that smoking tends to impair lung function. Much of the data to support this claim arises from studies of pulmonary function in adults who are long-time smokers. A question then arises whether such deleterious effects of smoking can be detected in children who smoke. To address this question, measures of lung function were made in about 600 children seen for a routine check up in a particular pediatric clinic. The children participating in this study were asked whether they were current smokers.\nA common measurement of lung function is the forced expiratory volume (FEV), which measures how much air you can blow out of your lungs in a short period of time. A higher FEV is usually associated with better respiratory function. It is well known that prolonged smoking diminishes FEV in adults, and those adults with diminished FEV also tend to have decreased pulmonary function as measured by other clinical variables, such as blood oxygen and carbon dioxide levels.\nData collected from the study on the relationship between smoking status and lung function (measured by FEV) in children are contained in the fev_tbl dataset.

Tasks that are more challenging will often be allocated more points.\nEach milestone will be also graded for reproducibility, cleanliness, and coherence of the overall Github submission.\nWhile the two milestones will be submitted as independent deliverables, the analysis itself is a continuum - think of it as two chapters to a story. Each chapter, or in this case, portion of your analysis, should be easily followed through by someone unfamiliar with the content. Here is a good resource for what constitutes “good code”. Learning good coding practices early in your career will save you hassle later on!\nThe milestones will be equally weighted."

    "title": "Bakeoff Example",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Example: Bake-off\nWe will demonstrate using data from “The Great British Bake Off” compiled by Allison Hill in the R package bakeoff. The graphics that follow (and the code to produce the graphics) were lightly adapted from Allison’s Plot Twist talk.\nFirst, let’s decide on some questions we can address with this data.\n\nHow did viewership change as new series came out?\nThe show moved channels after Series 7. Was viewership higher, lower, or about the same before and after the move?\n\nThese questions have implicitly defined our observations: they are individual units of the most granular populations we are trying to describe or compare. Here, the populations to be compared are series, and units within them are episodes. The variables now fall into place: they are measured attributes of our observations (episodes): episode number, viewership, series membership, etc. This means that the following representation of viewership data is tidy for the “change in viewership over series” analysis:\n\n# install.packages(\"bakeoff\") #uncomment if not yet installed\nlibrary(bakeoff)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\nratings_tbl1 &lt;- ratings %&gt;% #save output to new tibble called ratings_tbl1\n  mutate(ep_id = row_number()) %&gt;% # create variable for episode number\n  select(ep_id, viewers_7day, series, episode) #select specific columns\n\nhead(ratings_tbl1) #view first few rows of tibble\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 4\n  ep_id viewers_7day series episode\n  &lt;int&gt;        &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt;\n1     1         2.24      1       1\n2     2         3         1       2\n3     3         3         1       3\n4     4         2.6       1       4\n5     5         3.03      1       5\n6     6         2.75      1       6\n\n\nEvery row is an observation (a unique episode), and the columns are variables (episode number across series, 7-day viewership, series, and episode number within series).\nThis is a typical example where the tidy format makes it easy to do our analysis. For example, to investigate these questions, we might make a bar plot of the number of viewers in millions within a 7-day window per episode, coloured by series. The following code uses the tidy tibble ratings_tbl1 to make this bar plot. Notice that it was easy to use our graphing environment of choice (ggplot2 in the tidyverse) to make the plot because our data is tidy, and the tidyverse is designed to work with tidy data.\n\nseries_labels &lt;- ratings_tbl1 %&gt;% #save output to series_labels\n  mutate(series=as.factor(series)) %&gt;% #ensure series variable is a factor (categorical variable)\n  group_by(series) %&gt;% #group by series\n  summarize(y_position = median(viewers_7day) + 1, # calculate positions for the bar charts\n            x_position = mean(ep_id)) #\n\n# make the plot\nratings_tbl1 %&gt;% \n  mutate(series=as.factor(series)) %&gt;% # ensure series is a factor variable\n  ggplot(aes(x = ep_id, y = viewers_7day, fill = series)) + #set x and y axes, tell ggplot that we want things coloured by series\n    geom_col(alpha = .9) + #tell ggplot we want a boxplot, change translucency with alpha\n    ggtitle(\"7-Day Viewership across Series 1-10\") + #add a title\n    geom_text(data = series_labels, aes(label = series, #add text for series numbers\n                                      x = x_position, \n                                      y = y_position)) +\n    theme_classic() +  #add a classic theme\n    scale_fill_manual(values = bakeoff_palette(),\n                    guide = \"none\") + #set the colours so they aren't rainbow\n    xlab(\"Episode Number\") +  #add x axis label\n    ylab(\"7-Day Viewership (millions)\") #add y axis label\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow let’s consider a different set of questions:\n\nHow did viewership grow between premiere to final episode in each series?\nDoes the premiere-to-final-episode growth vary across series?\n\nTo investigate these questions, we might make a bar plot like the one below displaying percentage increase in the number of viewers in millions within a 7-day window from the premiere episode to finale episode for the first 10 series, using the tidy tibble ratings_tbl2:\n\nhead(ratings_tbl2)\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 3\n  series first  last\n  &lt;fct&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 1       2.24  2.75\n2 2       3.1   5.06\n3 3       3.85  6.74\n4 4       6.6   9.45\n5 5       8.51 13.5 \n6 6      11.6  15.0 \n\n\nFirst, we can calculate the percentage change in viewership using mutate():\n\nratings_tbl2 &lt;- ratings_tbl2 %&gt;%  #overwrite original df so new variable saves\n   mutate(pct_change = (last - first)/first) #calculate percent change\n\nhead(ratings_tbl2) #view first few rows of tibble\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 4\n  series first  last pct_change\n  &lt;fct&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;      &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 1       2.24  2.75      0.228\n2 2       3.1   5.06      0.632\n3 3       3.85  6.74      0.751\n4 4       6.6   9.45      0.432\n5 5       8.51 13.5       0.588\n6 6      11.6  15.0       0.295\n\n\nThen, we can visualize this using a bar chart:\n\nratings_tbl2 %&gt;% \n  ggplot(aes(x = fct_rev(series), y=pct_change)) + #initialize the plot\n  geom_col(fill = bakeoff::bakeoff_colors(\"baltic\"), alpha = .5) + #set bar chart with fill colours, semi-translucent \n  labs(x = \"Series\", y = \"% Increase in Viewers, First to Last Episode\") + #add x labels\n  ggtitle(\"% Increase in Viewers from Premiere to Finale\") + #add y labels\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent) + #change y axis to percentage \n  theme_classic() + #add classic theme\n  coord_flip() #flip horizontally\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 2\n\n\n\nWith a partner or a small group:\n\nWhat do you think ratings_tbl2 looks like?\nWhy is it tidy? (Hint: what are the observations and variables?)\nCould you have calculated the information in ratings_tbl2 using ratings_tbl1? (No need to write code - just discuss whether it’s possible.)\n\n\n\n\n\nPivoting Wider\nHere is some code to create a variable for whether an episode is the first or last episode of the season to ratings_tbl1 and subset to only the data from the first and last episodes of each season.\n\nratings_tbl1 &lt;- ratings_tbl1 %&gt;% #overwrite ratings_tbl1\n group_by(series) %&gt;% #group by series\n  filter(episode == 1 | episode == max(episode)) %&gt;% #get only the first and last episodes\n  ungroup() %&gt;% #ungroup the data\n  mutate(episode_fl = recode(episode, `1` = \"first\", .default = \"last\")) #add a new variable indicatign whether or not the episode was first or last, and recode the variable to \"first\" or \"last\"\n\nhead(ratings_tbl1)\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 5\n  ep_id viewers_7day series episode episode_fl\n  &lt;int&gt;        &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;     \n1     1         2.24      1       1 first     \n2     6         2.75      1       6 last      \n3     7         3.1       2       1 first     \n4    14         5.06      2       8 last      \n5    15         3.85      3       1 first     \n6    24         6.74      3      10 last      \n\n\nThis is not the same format as ratings_tbl2, which was the tidy format for our earlier “viewership growth within series” analysis. But it does contain the same information. To finish converting ratings_tbl1 into ratings_tbl2, we need to make ratings_tbl1 wider: we need to move some information in the rows (the info about whether each episode is the first or last episode of each season) into new columns.\nWe can solve this problem using pivot_wider, which needs three pieces of information.\n\nWhat is a set of columns that uniquely identifies each observation? Put their names in the id_cols argument.\nWhere should the names for the new columns come from? Put the name of the column you want to take the new variable names from in the names_from argument.\nWhat values should the new columns contain? Put the name of the columns you want to take the values from to values_from in the values_from argument.\n\nNote that if you don’t specify an id_cols argument, pivot_wider will assume that you want it to be every column except those in names_from and values_from.\n\nratings_tbl2 &lt;- ratings_tbl1 %&gt;% #overwrite ratings_tbl2\n  pivot_wider(id_cols = series, #pivot with id as series\n              names_from=episode_fl, #get column names from episode_fl\n              values_from=viewers_7day) #fill in values form viewers_7day\n\nhead(ratings_tbl2)\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 3\n  series first  last\n   &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;\n1      1  2.24  2.75\n2      2  3.1   5.06\n3      3  3.85  6.74\n4      4  6.6   9.45\n5      5  8.51 13.5 \n6      6 11.6  15.0 \n\n\nAlso note that any columns not included in id_cols, names_from, and values_from (e.g., ep_id) will simply be dropped.\nIf we wanted to keep the info in ep_id as well, we would add it to the values_from argument:\n\nratings_tbl1 %&gt;% \n  pivot_wider(id_cols = series, \n              names_from=episode_fl, \n              values_from=c(viewers_7day, ep_id)) #now including ep_id in the values_from call to include it in the output\n\n# A tibble: 10 × 5\n   series viewers_7day_first viewers_7day_last ep_id_first ep_id_last\n    &lt;dbl&gt;              &lt;dbl&gt;             &lt;dbl&gt;       &lt;int&gt;      &lt;int&gt;\n 1      1               2.24              2.75           1          6\n 2      2               3.1               5.06           7         14\n 3      3               3.85              6.74          15         24\n 4      4               6.6               9.45          25         34\n 5      5               8.51             13.5           35         44\n 6      6              11.6              15.0           45         54\n 7      7              13.6              15.9           55         64\n 8      8               9.46             10.0           65         74\n 9      9               9.55             10.3           75         84\n10     10               9.62             10.0           85         94\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"

Prior to creating any models, or using visualization to gain more insights about our data, it is common to tweak the data in some ways to make it a little easier to work with. For example, you may need to rename some variables, reorder observations, or even create some new variables from your existing ones!\nAs explained in depth in the R4DS Data Transformation chapter, there are five key dplyr functions that allow you to solve the vast majority of data manipulation tasks:\n\nPick variables by their names (select())\nPick observations by their values (filter())\nReorder the rows (arrange())\nCreate new variables with functions of existing variables (mutate())\nCollapse many rows down to a single summary (summarise())\n\nWe can use these in conjunction with two other functions:\n\nThe group_by() function groups a tibble by rows. Downstream calls to mutate() and summarise() operate independently on each group.\nThe across() function, when used within the mutate() and summarise() functions, operate on multiple columns.\n\nBecause data wrangling involves calling multiple of these functions, we will also see the pipe operator %&gt;% for putting these together in a single statement."

    "text": "Exploring your data\nWhat’s the first thing that you should do when you’re starting a project with a new dataset? Having a coffee is a reasonable answer, but before that, you should look at the data. This may sound obvious, but a common mistake is to dive into the analysis too early before being familiar with the data - only to have to go back to the start when something goes wrong and you can’t quite figure out why. Some of the questions you may want to ask are:\n\nWhat is the format of the data?\nWhat are the dimensions?\nAre there missing data?\n\nYou will learn how to answer these questions and more using dplyr."

Data were collected and made available by Dr. Kristen Gorman and the Palmer Station, Antarctica LTER, a member of the Long Term Ecological Research Network. The dataset that we will be using is stored in a variable called “penguins”. It is a subset of the “penguins_raw” dataset, also included in this R package. Let’s have a look at it.\n\nhead(penguins)\n\nhead() returns the first 6 rows of a dataframe, instead of printing all the data to screen."

This will give us a clue about the overall structure of the data.\n\nclass(penguins)\n\nAs you can see, the function returns 3 classes: “tbl_df”, “tbl”, and “data.frame”. A dataframe is the default class for data read into R. Tibbles (“tbl” and “tbl_df”) are a modern take on data frames, but slightly tweaked to work better in the tidyverse. For now, you don’t need to worry about the differences; we’ll come back to tibbles later. The dataset that we are working with was originally a data.frame that has been coerced into a tibble, which is why multiple class names are returned by the class() function."

If names get too long, remove vowels! For example, PngnSubset, or PngnTidy instead. Or, you can use snake_case!"

    "text": "The goal of this lecture is to learn how to install and setup key software for use in the course.\nTAs are available in class on Imagine Day from 9am-10:30am on Tuesday September 2nd to aid with installation. I highly recommend you join if you haven’t used RStudio, Jupyter, or GitHub before.\n\n\nYou may encounter some material that implicitly assumes that you are using a Mac. For example, they might point you to a Terminal app, or ask you to use Unix commands like which or ls. Here is a cheatsheet that helps you convert between Windows command line (“DOS”) and Mac command line (“UNIX”). One thing that’s missing is the equivalent to Unix’s which; the closest equivalent in DOS is where.\n\n\n\nR and RStudio The main programming language used in the class is R and our main IDE (a text editor with helpful features for writing and running code) is RStudio. The following instructions are adapted from Chapter 5 of Jenny Bryan’s “happy git” book.\n\nInstall (or update to) the latest release R on your computer (4.5.1 currently):\n\nWindows: https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/\nMac: https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/\n\nInstall RStudio\n\nhttps://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/\n\n\nEven if you already have R/RStudio, please update them to the most recent version!\n\n\n\nYou will need another IDE for R (Jupyter Notebook) and an R kernel called ‘IR Kernel’ (needed to run R code within Jupyter) to work on the autograded worksheets. This is because the autograder we use plays well with Jupyter.\nThe following instructions are adapted from Rich Pauloo.\nPC Installation:\n\nInstall Anaconda from https://www.anaconda.com/download\n\nProvide your email and an installation link will be sent to you\nInstall the full version of Anaconda (not miniconda)\n\nInstall and setup the IR Kernel\n\nLaunch Command Prompt (CMD) and execute where R. The output should be the path to the file R.exe. Copy the path.\nOpen the Anaconda Prompt application. Enter the following command into Anaconda Prompt: cd file_path_here where file_path_here is replaced with the location of the R.exe that you just found/copied\nRun R from within Anaconda Prompt by entering in R.exe. This opens an R session inside Anaconda Prompt. From here, enter the following commands in this order:\n\ninstall.packages(\"IRkernel\")\n\nIf you get an error, try install.packages(\"IRkernel\", force = TRUE)\nIf prompted to select a IR kernel mirror, select 12 (CANADA - MB).\n\nIRkernel::installspec()\n\n\nTo verify that everything is working, open Anaconda Prompt and type jupyter lab. Jupyter Lab should launch and display both a Python and R kernel.\n\nHaving trouble? Check the instructions here: https://richpauloo.github.io/2018-05-16-Installing-the-R-kernel-in-Jupyter-Lab/.\nMac OS Installation:\n\nInstall Anaconda from https://www.anaconda.com/download\n\nProvide your email and an installation link will be sent to you\nInstall the full version of Anaconda (not miniconda)\n\nInstall and setup the IR Kernel\n\nOpen R and navigate to the Console (see below).\n\n\n\nYour console may have a different appearance! Mine’s in dark mode.\n\n\nInstall the necessary packages by entering\ninstall.packages(c(\"repr\", \"IRdisplay\", \"evaluate\", \"crayon\", \"pbdZMQ\", \"devtools\", \"uuid\", \"digest\"))\ndevtools::install_github(\"IRkernel/IRkernel\")\nif you get an error, try devtools::install_github(\"IRkernel/IRkernel\", force = TRUE)\nExit RStudio.\n\nConfigure the IRkernel from within R\n\nIt’s important that these next commands are done from within the version of R that you want to link to Jupyter Lab (R version 5.4.1, for example)\nLaunch he Terminal application and type in which R (will probably output /usr/bin/R). Copy the path.\nThen, open a Finder window and at the top of your screen hit Go -&gt; go to folder and paste everything in the path except R (i.e., /usr/bin/). Scroll through and find R and open it.\nIn the R application, run IRkernel::installspec()\nIf prompted to choose a IRkernel mirror, select 12 (Canada - MB).\n\nLaunch Anaconda, and open a Jupyter Notebook and you should see an R kernel available.\n\nHaving trouble? Check out https://richpauloo.github.io/2018-05-16-Installing-the-R-kernel-in-Jupyter-Lab/.\n\n\n\nGit is a version control software. Github is a cloud-based platform (built on Git) for sharing code.\n\nRegister a Github account at github.com (if you don’t already have one).\n\nCreate a username that uses your actual name. Shorter is better! For example, mine is grcetmpk. See this for more information.\nYou don’t need to download any apps.\n\nInstall Git (more info here)\n\nSee if Git is already installed. For Mac OS, on the Terminal (Mac) type which git. For Windows, go to Command Prompt and type where git. If you get an error of git: command not found, you do not have git installed yet.\nWindows:\n\nInstall Git for Windows (https://gitforwindows.org/)\nWhen asked about “Adjusting your PATH environment”, make sure to select “Git from the command line and also from 3rd-party software”. Otherwise, keep the defaults.\n\nMac OS:\n\nInstall XCode Command Line Tools by opening Terminal and typing xcode-select --install (more info here)\nIn Terminal, enter git config. Click install.\n\n\nConfigure Git: In RStudio, navigate to the Terminal or Shell (see below).\n\n\n\nIf using Windows, you will have a Shell, not a Terminal.\n\n\nwithin the Terminal (Mac) or Shell (Windows) (Tools &gt; Terminal/Shell) do:\ngit config --global user.name \"your_github_username\"\ngit config --global user.email \"your_email_you_used_for_github@example.com\"\ngit config --global --list\nIf you are having issues, you could use the usethis package in R. See here.\nGet your Personal Access Token (PAT)\n\nOption 1: Go to to https://github.com/settings/tokens and click “Generate token”.\n\nChoose Classic Token\nDescribe the token’s purpose in the Note field, e.g. “personal-macbook” or “Stat545Installation”.\nSelect “repo”, “user”, and “workflow” for scopes.\nEnsure the token is valid for the entire semester (i.e., set the expiration for sometime in 2026).\nSave this token somewhere so you can use it again later, such as a password manager.\n\nOption 2: From R, execute usethis::create_github_token() (you may have to install the usethis package first by first running install.packages(\"usethis\")).\n\nDescribe the token’s purpose in the Note field, e.g. “personal-macbook” or “stat545installation”.\nEnsure the token is valid for the entire semester (i.e., set the expiration for sometime in 2026). Save this token somewhere so you can use it again later, such as a password manager.\n\n\nFrom R (in the console), run install.packages(\"gitcreds\") if you haven’t already.\nExecute gitcreds::gitcreds_set() and enter the PAT that you just made when prompted.",

    "text": "The goal of this lecture is to learn how to install and setup key software for use in the course.\nTAs are available in class on Imagine Day from 9am-10:30am on Tuesday September 2nd to aid with installation. I highly recommend you join if you haven’t used RStudio, Jupyter, or GitHub before.\n\n\nYou may encounter some material that implicitly assumes that you are using a Mac. For example, they might point you to a Terminal app, or ask you to use Unix commands like which or ls. Here is a cheatsheet that helps you convert between Windows command line (“DOS”) and Mac command line (“UNIX”). One thing that’s missing is the equivalent to Unix’s which; the closest equivalent in DOS is where.\n\n\n\nR and RStudio The main programming language used in the class is R and our main IDE (a text editor with helpful features for writing and running code) is RStudio. The following instructions are adapted from Chapter 5 of Jenny Bryan’s “happy git” book.\n\nInstall (or update to) the latest release R on your computer (4.5.1 currently):\n\nWindows: https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/\nMac: https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/\n\nInstall RStudio\n\nhttps://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/\n\n\nEven if you already have R/RStudio, please update them to the most recent version!\n\n\n\nYou will need another IDE for R (Jupyter Notebook) and an R kernel called ‘IR Kernel’ (needed to run R code within Jupyter) to work on the autograded worksheets. This is because the autograder we use plays well with Jupyter.\nThe following instructions are adapted from Rich Pauloo.\nPC Installation:\n\nInstall Anaconda from https://www.anaconda.com/download\n\nProvide your email and an installation link will be sent to you\nInstall the full version of Anaconda (not miniconda)\n\nInstall and setup the IR Kernel\n\nLaunch Command Prompt (CMD) and execute where R. The output should be the path to the file R.exe. Copy the path.\nOpen the Anaconda Prompt application. Enter the following command into Anaconda Prompt: cd file_path_here where file_path_here is replaced with the location of the R.exe that you just found/copied\nRun R from within Anaconda Prompt by entering in R.exe. This opens an R session inside Anaconda Prompt. From here, enter the following commands in this order:\n\ninstall.packages(\"IRkernel\")\n\nIf you get an error, try install.packages(\"IRkernel\", force = TRUE)\nIf prompted to select a IR kernel mirror, select 12 (CANADA - MB).\n\nIRkernel::installspec()\n\n\nTo verify that everything is working, open Anaconda Prompt and type jupyter lab. Jupyter Lab should launch and display both a Python and R kernel.\n\nHaving trouble? Check the instructions here: https://richpauloo.github.io/2018-05-16-Installing-the-R-kernel-in-Jupyter-Lab/.\nMac OS Installation:\n\nInstall Anaconda from https://www.anaconda.com/download\n\nProvide your email and an installation link will be sent to you\nInstall the full version of Anaconda (not miniconda)\n\nInstall and setup the IR Kernel\n\nOpen R and navigate to the Console (see below).\n\n\n\nYour console may have a different appearance! Mine’s in dark mode.\n\n\nInstall the necessary packages by entering\ninstall.packages(c(\"repr\", \"IRdisplay\", \"evaluate\", \"crayon\", \"pbdZMQ\", \"devtools\", \"uuid\", \"digest\"))\ndevtools::install_github(\"IRkernel/IRkernel\")\nif you get an error, try devtools::install_github(\"IRkernel/IRkernel\", force = TRUE)\nExit RStudio.\n\nConfigure the IRkernel from within R\n\nIt’s important that these next commands are done from within the version of R that you want to link to Jupyter Lab (R version 5.4.1, for example)\nLaunch he Terminal application and type in which R (will probably output /usr/bin/R). Copy the path.\nThen, open a Finder window and at the top of your screen hit Go -&gt; go to folder and paste everything in the path except R (i.e., /usr/bin/). Scroll through and find R and open it.\nIn the R application, run IRkernel::installspec()\nIf prompted to choose a IRkernel mirror, select 12 (Canada - MB).\n\nLaunch Anaconda, and open a Jupyter Notebook and you should see an R kernel available.\n\nHaving trouble? Check out https://richpauloo.github.io/2018-05-16-Installing-the-R-kernel-in-Jupyter-Lab/.\n\n\n\nGit is a version control software. Github is a cloud-based platform (built on Git) for sharing code.\n\nRegister a Github account at github.com (if you don’t already have one).\n\nCreate a username that uses your actual name. Shorter is better! For example, mine is grcetmpk. See this for more information.\nYou don’t need to download any apps.\n\nInstall Git (more info here)\n\nSee if Git is already installed. For Mac OS, on the Terminal (Mac) type which git. For Windows, go to Command Prompt and type where git. If you get an error of git: command not found, you do not have git installed yet.\nWindows:\n\nInstall Git for Windows (https://gitforwindows.org/)\nWhen asked about “Adjusting your PATH environment”, make sure to select “Git from the command line and also from 3rd-party software”. Otherwise, keep the defaults.\n\nMac OS:\n\nInstall XCode Command Line Tools by opening Terminal and typing xcode-select --install (more info here)\nIn Terminal, enter git config. Click install.\n\n\nConfigure Git: In RStudio, navigate to the Terminal or Shell (see below).\n\n\n\nIf using Windows, you will have a Shell, not a Terminal.\n\n\nwithin the Terminal (Mac) or Shell (Windows) (Tools &gt; Terminal/Shell) do:\ngit config --global user.name \"your_github_username\"\ngit config --global user.email \"your_email_you_used_for_github@example.com\"\ngit config --global --list\nIf you are having issues, you could use the usethis package in R. See here.\nGet your Personal Access Token (PAT)\n\nOption 1: Go to to https://github.com/settings/tokens and click “Generate token”.\n\nChoose Classic Token\nDescribe the token’s purpose in the Note field, e.g. “personal-macbook” or “Stat545Installation”.\nSelect “repo”, “user”, and “workflow” for scopes.\nEnsure the token is valid for the entire semester (i.e., set the expiration for sometime in 2026).\nSave this token somewhere so you can use it again later, such as a password manager.\n\nOption 2: From R, execute usethis::create_github_token() (you may have to install the usethis package first by first running install.packages(\"usethis\")).\n\nDescribe the token’s purpose in the Note field, e.g. “personal-macbook” or “stat545installation”.\nEnsure the token is valid for the entire semester (i.e., set the expiration for sometime in 2026). Save this token somewhere so you can use it again later, such as a password manager.\n\n\nFrom R (in the console), run install.packages(\"gitcreds\") if you haven’t already.\nExecute gitcreds::gitcreds_set() and enter the PAT that you just made when prompted.",

    "text": "From today’s class, students are anticipated to be able to:\n\nRead and write a delimited file, like a csv, from R using the readr package.\nMake relative paths using the here::here() function.\nRead data from a spreadsheet\nRead and write R binary files (rds files) from R.\n\nRequired packages:\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(here)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nIn some of the eariler examples, I will be demonstrating using absolute and relative file paths. On Mac OS, files are written with forward slashes (i.e., datasets/penguins.csv). On Windows, backslashes are used (i.e., datasets\\penguins.csv). My examples are writted for MacOS - the only thing you’d need to change in the examples are the direction of the slashes if you plan to reproduce my code!\nLater in the lecture, we discuss the here::here() function which solves this problem completely.\n\n\nCommon file formats include\n\nSpreadsheets: Excel, Google Sheets, Numbers\nDelimited files: Plaintext files containing data, e.g. comma separated values (CSVs), tab separated values (TSVs)\nR binary: A serialization of an R object to a binary file. Basically, that means that it can be loaded in and out of R, but it can’t be opened by anything but R.\n\nCSVs are the most “one-size-fits-all”: you can open them in spreadsheet software, but they are also plaintext, so are lightweight, can be opened in any text editor, and can be “diff”ed. Spreadsheets are nice for human interaction (like through Excel), but can be clunky in R. R binary is quite restrictive and we don’t tend to store data this way. Our lecture will focus on CSVs.\n\n\nJenny Bryan’s website has a fabulous section on reading and writing files in R. We’re going to summarize a few of the important functions here, but if you’d like to learn more then check out that website for more in-depth explorations!\nWe are going to focus on reading and writing data using the readr package, because we think it has the most “work right out of the box” experience.\nWe will start by talking about how to read and write Comma Separated Value (CSV) files (files that end in .csv). CSVs are often used to store data. When the penguins data set is stored as a .csv, the first few entries look like when opened as a text file:\nspecies,island,bill_len,bill_dep,flipper_len,body_mass,sex,year\nAdelie,Torgersen,39.1,18.7,181,3750,male,2007 Adelie,Torgersen,39.5,17.4,186,3800,female,2007 Adelie,Torgersen,40.3,18,195,3250,female,2007 Adelie,Torgersen,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,2007 Adelie,Torgersen,36.7,19.3,193,3450,female,2007 Adelie,Torgersen,39.3,20.6,190,3650,male,2007 Adelie,Torgersen,38.9,17.8,181,3625,female,2007 Adelie,Torgersen,39.2,19.6,195,4675,male,2007\nNow, this isn’t exactly easy for humans to read, but saving data as CSVs has its advantages. The data is stored in a simple form (lightweight - files aren’t large) that has broad compatibility and can be used in a wide range of applications. And of course, we can use functions in R to make it more readable. A few main functions of note are\n\nread_csv(): tidyverse equivalent of read.csv() used to read from a CSV to a tibble\nwrite_csv(): tidyverse equivalent of write.csv() used to export a tibble into CSV format\n\nLet’s assume that a file called penguins.csv is saved in a dataset folder in our current directory. We can read in, and save the tibble as a variable called penguins using:\n\npenguins &lt;- read_csv(\"datasets/penguins.csv\")\n\nRows: 344 Columns: 8\n── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nDelimiter: \",\"\nchr (3): species, island, sex\ndbl (5): bill_len, bill_dep, flipper_len, body_mass, year\n\nℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.\nℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.\n\nhead(penguins)\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 8\n  species island    bill_len bill_dep flipper_len body_mass sex     year\n  &lt;chr&gt;   &lt;chr&gt;        &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;       &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 Adelie  Torgersen     39.1     18.7         181      3750 male    2007\n2 Adelie  Torgersen     39.5     17.4         186      3800 female  2007\n3 Adelie  Torgersen     40.3     18           195      3250 female  2007\n4 Adelie  Torgersen     NA       NA            NA        NA &lt;NA&gt;    2007\n5 Adelie  Torgersen     36.7     19.3         193      3450 female  2007\n6 Adelie  Torgersen     39.3     20.6         190      3650 male    2007\n\n\nPretty easy! Note that the file path needs to be a string, relative to where you are now in the directory (i.e., where the R script you’re working on is saved. You can always call getwd() to see what directory you’re working on currently, and we’ll show more tools for dealing with directories later in this lecture.)\nWe can manipulate the data, and save the output as a new CSV. For example,\n\npenguins_2007 &lt;- penguins %&gt;%\n  filter(year == 2007) #filter only on year 2007\n\nwrite_csv(penguins_2007, \"datasets/penguins_2007.csv\") #save csv in datasets folder, name as penguins_2007.csv\n\nNow, in my datasets folder, I have penguins and penguins_2007.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nWant to read and write to an Excel file? The readxl package in the tidyverse is for you!\nFor the very niche option of R binary: read_rds() and write_rds().\n\n\n\n\n\nAs previously mentioned, we need to specify where we are reading/writing our data from/to. The best practice is to use a relative path. This helps with reproducibility and automation!\nI could always read in my penguins dataset using an absolute file path where the file path begins at the root of your computer (for me, it is a long chain of folders in /Users/......../STAT545/stat454.github.io/webpages/lectures_i/datasets/penguins.csv). This, however, is not best practice. As previously mentioned, this string telling me where the file path is can also differ for Windows users! I’d have to manually change all of the forward slashes to backslashes to make this run on Windows.\nWe will use the here package for relative file paths. Let’s (install, if necessary, and) load it and call the function here()\n\n\n# install.packages(\"here\")\nlibrary(here)\nhere()\n\n[1] \"/Users/gracetompkins/Library/CloudStorage/OneDrive-UBC/Teaching/STAT545/STAT545.github.io\"\n\n\nI get that long chain of folders where this R Project (which I used to build this website) is stored. The cool thing about here is that I can specify a file path relative to my project root (the above location) without using any operating system-specific strings.\nFor example, the penguins.csv data set is located in webpages &gt; lectures_i &gt; datasets within my R project folder. I can access it by:\n\npenguins &lt;- read_csv(here(\"webpages\", \"lectures_i\", \"datasets\", \"penguins.csv\"))\n\nRows: 344 Columns: 8\n── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nDelimiter: \",\"\nchr (3): species, island, sex\ndbl (5): bill_len, bill_dep, flipper_len, body_mass, year\n\nℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.\nℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.\n\nhead(penguins) #view first few entries of the tibble\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 8\n  species island    bill_len bill_dep flipper_len body_mass sex     year\n  &lt;chr&gt;   &lt;chr&gt;        &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;       &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 Adelie  Torgersen     39.1     18.7         181      3750 male    2007\n2 Adelie  Torgersen     39.5     17.4         186      3800 female  2007\n3 Adelie  Torgersen     40.3     18           195      3250 female  2007\n4 Adelie  Torgersen     NA       NA            NA        NA &lt;NA&gt;    2007\n5 Adelie  Torgersen     36.7     19.3         193      3450 female  2007\n6 Adelie  Torgersen     39.3     20.6         190      3650 male    2007\n\n\nThis is reproducible!"

    "section": "Effective Data Visualization",
    "text": "Effective Data Visualization\nPlots and other forms of data visualization are powerful tools for conveying complex relationships. While tables can be useful, data visualizations are often preferred to aid with identify patterns and relationships and emphasizing important findings in a research projects. This is especially true for presentations, where the audience may not have time to digest a large table of numbers. Jenny Bryan’s Challenger Example (https://speakerdeck.com/jennybc/ggplot2-tutorial) is a great example of why we may want to visualize data.\nNow the question is, what visualization should you use to convey an idea? Well, you need to first formulate the question you want the data visualization to answer. That is, you need to figure out what you want to convey before you start visualizing the data. From UBC’s A First Introduction to Data Science [1] book:\n\n“A good visualization will clearly answer your question without distraction; a great visualization will suggest even what the question was itself without additional explanation. Imagine your visualization as part of a poster presentation for a project; even if you aren’t standing at the poster explaining things, an effective visualization will convey your message to the audience.”\n\nWe need to convey the message using a data visualization while removing as much unnecessary information as possible. Below is a direct quote from the A First Introduction to Data Science [1] containing their suggestions for effective data visualizations:\n“Convey the message”\n\nMake sure the visualization answers the question you have asked most simply and plainly as possible.\nUse legends and labels so that your visualization is understandable without reading the surrounding text.\nEnsure the text, symbols, lines, etc., on your visualization are big enough to be easily read.\nEnsure the data are clearly visible; don’t hide the shape/distribution of the data behind other objects (e.g., a bar).\nMake sure to use color schemes that are understandable by those with colorblindness (a surprisingly large fraction of the overall population—from about 1% to 10%, depending on sex and ancestry [2]). For example, ColorBrewer and the RColorBrewer R package [3] provide the ability to pick such color schemes, and you can check your visualizations after you have created them by uploading to online tools such as a color blindness simulator.\nRedundancy can be helpful; sometimes conveying the same message in multiple ways reinforces it for the audience.\n\n“Minimize noise”\n\nUse colors sparingly. Too many different colors can be distracting, create false patterns, and detract from the message.\nBe wary of overplotting. Overplotting is when marks that represent the data overlap, and is problematic as it prevents you from seeing how many data points are represented in areas of the visualization where this occurs. If your plot has too many dots or lines and starts to look like a mess, you need to do something different.\nOnly make the plot area (where the dots, lines, bars are) as big as needed. Simple plots can be made small.\nDon’t adjust the axes to zoom in on small differences. If the difference is small, show that it’s small!",

    "section": "ggplot2 and the Grammar of Graphics",
    "text": "ggplot2 and the Grammar of Graphics\nIf you’ve learned about data visualization in R before, you’ve likely produced plots using “base R” methods (for example, the boxplot() function in R. It is a simple framework for making plots and is often “enough” for producing basic plots. In this lecture, we are going to dive into ggplot2, a package R users often use to make more sophisticated plots! If you’ve never used R to plot before, don’t worry. We aren’t assuming you have any experience with either method of plotting in R.\nWe will be utilising the ggplot2 and tidyverse packages throughout this lecture. To load them:\n\n# install.packages(\"tidyverse\") #uncomment if not already installed\n# install.packages(\"ggplot2\") #uncomment if not already installed\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\nggplot2 is based on the grammar of graphics, which is a systematic approach for describing different components or aspects of a graph. It involves seven components (required components are indicated with the *):\n\nData*\n\nthe data you’re feeding into the plot, perhaps a tibble or dataframe\n\nAesthetic mappings*\n\na specification of how you will connect variables (for example, horizontal or vertical positioning, grouping, size, colour, shape)\n\nGeometric objects*\n\na specification of what the object will be drawn as (for example, a scatter plot, line, bar chart)\n\nScales\n\na specification of how a variable is mapped to its aesthetic\n\nStatistical transformations\n\na specification of whether and how the data are combined or transformed. For example, is a bar chart plotting the values or a relative frequency?\n\nCoordinate system\n\na specification of how the position aesthetics (x and y) are depicted in the plot. We typically use cartesian coordinates, though polar coordinates are also possible.\n\nFacet\n\na specification of data variables that partition the data into smaller “sub plots” or panels\n\n\nIt’s okay if you don’t quite understand all of these components yet. We will walk through examples of commonly used plots and discuss which components are necessary!\n\nExample 1: Scatterplot on mtcars\nLet’s say you’d like to see if there is a relationship between miles per gallon and horsepower of cars in the mtcars data set. As both of these variables are numeric, we could build a scatterplot.\nThe ggplot() function takes two arguments: data (the data frame or tibble containing your data that you’d like to plot) and mapping (aesthetic mappings applied to the entire plot. We use the aes() function inside of this argument.).\nLet’s start building the scatterplot! Let’s plot mpg (miles per gallon) on the x axis and hp on the y axis by piping the dataset into the ggplot function:\n\nmtcars %&gt;% \n  ggplot(aes(x = hp, y = mpg))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice that we haven’t actually plotted anything! ggplot doesn’t know what type of plot we want to draw, only that we want mpg on the x axis and hp on the y axis from the mtcars data we provided. To tell ggplot that we want a scatterplot, we are going to add a layer to the plot using the + at the end of the previous line. geom_point() is the geometric object we’d like to add (i.e., a scatterplot):\n\nmtcars %&gt;% \n  ggplot(aes(x = hp, y = mpg)) + \n  geom_point()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe now have created a scatterplot! It’s fine, but we can elevate this. Let’s colour the points by the number of cylinders!\n\nmtcars %&gt;% \n  ggplot(aes(x = hp, y = mpg, color = cyl)) + \n    geom_point()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHmmm. That’s not quite right! There are only 3 types of cylinders in our data set! (Don’t believe me? Try running unique(mtcars$cyl)). Because cyl is written as a number, R is probably going to read it as a numeric value. However, we only have three possible categories for the number of cylinders, so we first should tell R to treat this as a categorical variable! We can do this with mutate, where we overwrite the cyl variable as a factor. Then, we use color = cyl in the aes() function to tell ggplot to colour by this category!\n\nmtcars %&gt;% \n  mutate(cyl = as.factor(cyl)) %&gt;%\n  ggplot(aes(x = hp, y = mpg, color = cyl)) + \n    geom_point()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCool! But… this isn’t super colourblind-friendly. Let’s turn to the RColorBrewer package to select a friendlier colour scheme. The colour pallet “Set2” is more colourblind-friendly:\n\nmtcars %&gt;% \n  mutate(cyl = as.factor(cyl)) %&gt;%\n  ggplot(aes(x = hp, y = mpg, color = cyl)) + \n    geom_point() + \n    scale_color_brewer(palette = \"Set2\") \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo be even more accessible, let’s change the shape of the points by cylinder type by adding shape = cyl to the aes()!\n\nmtcars %&gt;% \n  mutate(cyl = as.factor(cyl)) %&gt;%\n  ggplot(aes(x = hp, y = mpg, color = cyl, shape = cyl)) + \n    geom_point() + \n    scale_color_brewer(palette = \"Set2\") \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, let’s add better labels to our X and Y axes:\n\nmtcars %&gt;% \n  mutate(cyl = as.factor(cyl)) %&gt;%\n  ggplot(aes(x = hp, y = mpg, color = cyl, shape = cyl)) + \n    geom_point() + \n    scale_color_brewer(palette = \"Set2\")  +\n    xlab(\"Horsepower\") + \n    ylab(\"Miles Per Gallon\") \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can also change the title of our legend. We’ll have to specify the title twice as we’ve grouped by colour and shape:\n\nmtcars %&gt;% \n  mutate(cyl = as.factor(cyl)) %&gt;%\n  ggplot(aes(x = hp, y = mpg, color = cyl, shape = cyl)) + \n    geom_point() + \n    scale_color_brewer(palette = \"Set2\")  +\n    xlab(\"Horsepower\") + \n    ylab(\"Miles Per Gallon\") +\n    labs(color = \"Number of Cylinders\", shape = \"Number of Cylinders\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe grey background is still a bit distracting, so we could remove it by giving out ggplot a more minimal theme:\n\nmtcars %&gt;% \n  mutate(cyl = as.factor(cyl)) %&gt;%\n  ggplot(aes(x = hp, y = mpg, color = cyl, shape = cyl)) + \n    geom_point() + \n    scale_color_brewer(palette = \"Set2\")  +\n    xlab(\"Horsepower\") + \n    ylab(\"Miles Per Gallon\") +\n    labs(color = \"Number of Cylinders\", shape = \"Number of Cylinders\") +\n    theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd finally, let’s add a descriptive title!\n\nmtcars %&gt;% \n  mutate(cyl = as.factor(cyl)) %&gt;%\n  ggplot(aes(x = hp, y = mpg, color = cyl, shape = cyl)) + \n    geom_point() + \n    scale_color_brewer(palette = \"Set2\")  +\n    xlab(\"Horsepower\") + \n    ylab(\"Miles Per Gallon\") +\n    labs(color = \"Number of Cylinders\", shape = \"Number of Cylinders\") +\n    theme_minimal() + \n    ggtitle(\"Relationship between Number of Cylinders, Miles per Gallon, \\nand Horsepower on the mtcars Dataset\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe \\n in the title is a special character that allows the line to break and fit on this size of plot.\nNow, this is a nice visualization! We can clearly see that cars with higher horsepower tend to be less fuel efficient (have lower miles per gallon). Cars with higher horsepower also tend to have a higher number of cylinders.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nNames of axes should have quotations “” around them.\nThe order of the layers doesn’t matter after the geom_layer() layer.\n\n\n\n\nCommon Types of Plots\n\ngeom_point(): scatterplot\ngeom_line(): line plot\ngeom_bar(): bar chart\ngeom_histogram(): histogram\ngeom_boxplot(): box plot\ngeom_smooth(): adds a smooth trend line (various methods)\n\n\n\nAdvice for ggplot\nGoogle is absolutely your friend when building ggplots. I don’t think I’ve ever made a plot without googling how to do it. ggplot is extremely powerful, flexible, and a bit scary to learn! If you need to build a plot, search it! Need to plot two histograms, separated by groups (say, gender), side by side? I’d google: “ggplot histogram grouped by variable”. This brings me to this blog post by R Charts that has a TON of different side by side histograms with code! ggplot is very much a “learn by doing” skill.",

This will give provide you with dedicated time to work on the assessments in class with access to the instructor and the TAs.\nMany lectures will have an accompanying video, which will be linked on the webpage and on our STAT545 YouTube Playlist.\nLectures build on top of each other and it is crucial to stay on track as we progress through this course.",

    "section": "Coding in R: The Basics",
    "text": "Coding in R: The Basics\nLet’s get started! By this point, I’m assuming you’ve successfully installed R, RStudio, Github, and Jupyter notebooks. If you haven’t, check out the previous lecture for a guide to setting up this software.\nBefore diving into the worksheet, let’s talk about R. R is an open source programming language designed for statistical computing and data analysis. It is a commonly used programming language alongside Python and SAS, which we will not be covering in this course.\nCheck out this YouTube video for a short video lecture covering the basics of R Studio and R.\n\nCalculations\nIn its simplest form, R is a calculator. For example, we can type 1 + 2 in the console of R (we will be using RStudio) will spit out the answer of 3.\n\n1 + 2\n\n[1] 3\n\n\nThe [1] in the answer can be ignored for now.\nR can also be used to do more complex expressions, such as \\((450 - 15)^2/(5 + 7\\times4)\\), which we would write in R with:\n\n(450-15)^2/(5+7*4)\n\n[1] 5734.091\n\n\n\n\nVariables\nR can also be used to store values as a variable. To assign a value to a variable in R, we use the &lt;- symbol (the less than symbol followed by the minus sign). For example, if I wanted to store the number of apartments I’ve lived in since moving out for university, I could assign this to a variable called apartments_lived_in by:\n\napartments_lived_in &lt;- 4\n\nThen, if I later wanted to use this value, I could simply execute\n\napartments_lived_in\n\n[1] 4\n\n\nwhich you can see stores the value of 4! I can also do math on this variable, for example multiplying it by 2:\n\napartments_lived_in*2\n\n[1] 8\n\n\nVariables can also store the results of expressions, which we will dive into in Worksheet 1.\n\n\nComments\nComments are lines (or parts of lines) of code that R ignores. We specify them using #. Commenting can be useful for documenting what you’re doing, or temporarily stopping a line from running. For example:\n\n# The following lines will run!\nx &lt;- 4 + 7\nx\n\n[1] 11\n\n# I can even comment beside executable code lines\ny &lt;- 9*5 #here I'm muliplying 9 and 5, and saving it as y\ny\n\n[1] 45\n\n# The next few lines will not run\n# z &lt;- 4/6\n# z\n\n\n\nData Structures\nR isn’t just a calculator. R can handle different data structures (which are just objects that contain data) including strings, vectors, and data frames (just to name a few). We will go over the basics of these structures in this section.\n\nStrings\nA string is a R (often called character data) is a string of characters enclosed in quotations. For example, I could store my name in a variable called name:\n\nname &lt;- \"Grace\"\n\nand access it later by typing name\n\nname\n\n[1] \"Grace\"\n\n\nStrings can also have white spaces and punctuation, such as\n\nmanifestation &lt;- \"I'm a great R coder!\"\nmanifestation\n\n[1] \"I'm a great R coder!\"\n\n\nYou can use single ' or double \" quotation marks to wrap around the string - just be consistent!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nIn some worksheets, questions are multiple choice. Ensure that you type your answer as a string, i.e., my_answer &lt;- \"A\".\n\n\n\n\nNumeric Vectors\nA vector is an ordered list of items of the same type. A numeric vector is an ordered list of numbers.\nVectors are created in R using the c() function, with elements separated by commas. For example, suppose someone wanted to store the number of roommates they lived with in their four apartments. They had 4 roommates in their first apartment, then 2 in their next, followed by 3, and finally lived alone with 0 roommates. We can save this information in a vector named roommates using the following code:\n\nroommates &lt;- c(4, 2, 3, 0)\n\nTo see the contents of a vector, simply type its name in the console and run the code\n\nroommates\n\n[1] 4 2 3 0\n\n\nWe can access each element of the vector by indexing it with []. In R, unlike some other programming languages, the index starts at 1. So if you’d like to access the first element of the vector, you can use [1]. For example, to see the number of roommates in my first apartment, I could use\n\nroommates[1]\n\n[1] 4\n\n\nOr view the number of roommates in my third apartment using:\n\nroommates[3]\n\n[1] 3\n\n\nWe can also perform functions on vectors! Suppose we wanted to calculate the total number of occupants in each apartment (including myself). I need to add one person to each apartment! To do so, I can make a new variable called totaloccupants which is equal to roommates plus one:\n\ntotaloccupants &lt;- roommates + 1\ntotaloccupants\n\n[1] 5 3 4 1\n\n\nWe will dive more into functions on vectors in Worksheet 1.\n\n\nLogical Vectors\nA logical vector is a vector where the elements are a logical statement containing TRUE or FALSE. Let’s see how we can create a vector indicating whether or not there were more than two roommates in a given apartment. We can store this as a variable, named more_than_two_roommates using\n\nmore_than_two_roommates &lt;- roommates &gt; 2\nmore_than_two_roommates\n\n[1]  TRUE FALSE  TRUE FALSE\n\n\nFrom the output, you can see that this statement is true for apartments 1 and 3, indicating there were more than two roommates for these apartments.\n\n\nOther useful functions on vectors\nR has a number of built in functions that are useful for exploring vectors. We can check the length (number of elements) of a vector using the length() function:\n\nlength(roommates)\n\n[1] 4\n\n\nThis answer makes sense as we had data for four apartments. We can also look at the types of data stored in vectors using the typeof function\n\ntypeof(roommates)\n\n[1] \"double\"\n\ntypeof(totaloccupants)\n\n[1] \"double\"\n\ntypeof(more_than_two_roommates)\n\n[1] \"logical\"\n\n\ndouble is a type of numeric data. logical is the type of data that stores TRUE/FALSE.\n\n\nDataframes\nDataframes are a powerful tool for storing multidimensional data. For example, we could have data on housing for multiple people, including the rent paid, number of roommates, city, etc. Dataframes are a convenient way to store such information. Suppose we have data on three individuals stored in the dataframe housingdata. To access it, type housingdata in the R Console.\n\nhousingdata\n\n   Name NumRooms NumOccupants Rent      City\n1 Grace        2            2 2700 Vancouver\n2   Mei        3            4 5000   Toronto\n3   Sam        1            1 1900   Halifax\n\n\nWe see that Grace rents a 2 bedroom apartment, with two total occupants, and the total rent is $2700 per month in Vancouver. Mei lives in Toronto and has a 3 bedroom apartment shared between 4 people, and the total rent is $5000. Sam lives alone in a one bedroom apartment in Halifax, and pays $1900.\nWe will focus more on dataframes in a coming lecture, but I wanted to mention them here.\n\n\n\nRStudio and Saving your R Code\nThat’s great, but do I really have to run code one line at a time? No! RStudio provides us with an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) that allows you to save R Scripts (documents containing your R code). It’s free and open-source!\nR Studio will look like this (mine is a dark theme):\n\nI’ve highlighted some important pieces:\nConsole\n\nUseful for quick calculations you don’t want to save, debugging\n\nUntitled1\n\nan R Script (currently unsaved/untitled)\nSaves your code\n(P.S., You can create an R Script by going File &gt; New File &gt; R Script)\n\nTerminal\n\nUsed for command line programming. We will use this later when connecting to GitHub (ignore for now but know it exists!)\n\nEnvironment\n\nShows your saved variables, data structures, etc (currently empty)\n\nIt’s okay if your RStudio is configured differently! You can move the positions of some of these panes in the settings.\nFor any code you’d like to save, we write it in an R Script! Let’s create a file called roommates.R. In RStudio, go to File &gt; New File &gt; R Script. Now, go to File &gt; Save As… and save it somewhere that makes sense for you (i.e., a STAT545 folder).\nInstead of working line by line, let’s add the following (very simple) code to roommates.R to calculate the total number of occupants in each apartment lived in:\nroommates &lt;- c(4, 2, 3, 0)\ntotaloccupants &lt;- roommates + 1\ntotaloccupants\nSave your work.\nYour RStudio will look something like this:\n\nTo run the code, we can highlight it and click the “Run” button or click cmd/ctrl + Shift + Enter to run all code in the R Script. You will notice the code gets sent line by line to the Console, and the variables you created will now be in the Environment.\n\nNow, anytime you want to run that code you have it right there! You can also edit the code and re-run it to update the variables.\nThe variables are stored in the environment. If you want to start fresh, you can click the broom button in the environment which will clear your variables. Then, run your code from top to bottom again.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 1: Update roommates.R\n\n\n\nYour landlord has decided that pets count as occupants! You’ve lived with a pet cat since you moved into your first apartment. Update the code in your roommates.R file to reflect this, and re-run it to get the new total number of occupants in each apartment.\nSave the file.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 2: Playing in the Console\n\n\n\nOut of curiosity, you wanted to see how many occupants were in your friend’s apartment. You don’t really want to save this code, so you go to the Console to play around with the numbers. Your friend had 5 roommates in first year, then 3 in second year, then 1 roommate in third and fourth years. You execute the following code in the R Console (not touching roommates.R):\n\nroommates &lt;- c(5, 3, 1, 1)\ntotaloccupants &lt;- roommates + 1\ntotaloccupants\n\n[1] 6 4 2 2\n\n\nDid anything in your Environment change?\n\n\nWell… even though you didn’t touch roommates.R, you overwrote the roommates and totaloccupants variables!\n\nSo remember, the console is not a separate (functionally) in R. Anything you do in the console will affect your variables in the environment. Of course, if we were to clear our environment and re-run the roommates.R file, we’d go back to our original data.\nThose are the basics of RStudio! You will learn more as the course progresses.",

In practice, it’s very rare that you have the data in the exact right form to make the graph you want, or fit the model you want. You will need to start by manipulating your data into the right form: creating new variables, subsetting rows, renaming columns, etc.\nPlus, an important piece of data analysis output is tables that summarize the data in some way. For example, it is extremely standard practice in biomedical and public health studies to have the first table of any journal article summarize basic characteristics of the study population, possibly stratified by exposure. While these tables are less pretty than graphs, they can nevertheless be very insightful!\nAn even less exciting but perhaps even more important part of data analysis is simply checking the data for things like:\n\nPossible inconsistencies with your understanding of what the data set should contain\nPossible errors\nBasic info gathering: number of rows, number of columns, amount of missing data, etc.\n\nAll of these require data manipulation.

    "section": "Tibbles",
    "text": "Tibbles\nAs mentioned in Lecture 1A, data frames are useful tools for storing data. You can think of it as a spreadsheet of information, but in R. A tibble is a modern version of a basic data frame. To use tibbles, we first install the tibble package (if we haven’t already) and load it into R by:\n\n# install.packages(\"tibble\") # remove comment if not already installed\nlibrary(tibble)\n\nTibbles typically said to be more user friendly than standard R dataframes, and are easily used with tidyverse functions. More on that in a bit!\nWe can either load in pre-existing data frames (like from a .csv file or an R package), or create a tibble manually using the tibble() function. For example, we could use\n\ntibble(x = letters)\n\n# A tibble: 26 × 1\n   x    \n   &lt;chr&gt;\n 1 a    \n 2 b    \n 3 c    \n 4 d    \n 5 e    \n 6 f    \n 7 g    \n 8 h    \n 9 i    \n10 j    \n# ℹ 16 more rows\n\n\nto have a single column tibble of letters of the alphabet, or\n\nhousingdata &lt;- tibble(name = c(\"Grace\", \"Mei\", \"Steven\", \"Phuong\", \"Omar\", \"Richa\", \"Bruce\", \"David\"), \n                      numrooms = c(2, 3, 1, 4, 2, 1, 3, 2), \n                      rent_2024 = c(2665, 4900, 2900, 4950, 2400, 1000, 2800, 2350),\n                      rent_2025 = c(2700, 5000, 2900, 5000, 2500, 1000, 2800, 2400),\n                      city = c(\"Vancouver\", \"Toronto\", \"Halifax\", \"Vancouver\", \"Montreal\", \"Victoria\", \"Halifax\", \"Vancouver\"))\nhousingdata\n\n# A tibble: 8 × 5\n  name   numrooms rent_2024 rent_2025 city     \n  &lt;chr&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;    \n1 Grace         2      2665      2700 Vancouver\n2 Mei           3      4900      5000 Toronto  \n3 Steven        1      2900      2900 Halifax  \n4 Phuong        4      4950      5000 Vancouver\n5 Omar          2      2400      2500 Montreal \n6 Richa         1      1000      1000 Victoria \n7 Bruce         3      2800      2800 Halifax  \n8 David         2      2350      2400 Vancouver\n\n\nWe can see that the tibble can store different data types (here we have both numeric data (“dbl” is short for double) and character data (“chr” is short for character).\nWe can also change an R data frame to a tibble. For example, the mtcars data set is available in the datasets package in R as a dataframe. We can load it as a tibble using:\n\nlibrary(datasets)\ntibble(mtcars)\n\n# A tibble: 32 × 11\n     mpg   cyl  disp    hp  drat    wt  qsec    vs    am  gear  carb\n   &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1  21       6 160     110  3.9  2.62  16.46     0     1     4     4\n 2  21       6 160     110  3.9  2.875 17.02     0     1     4     4\n 3  22.8     4 108      93  3.85 2.32  18.61     1     1     4     1\n 4  21.4     6 258     110  3.08 3.215 19.44     1     0     3     1\n 5  18.7     8 360     175  3.15 3.44  17.02     0     0     3     2\n 6  18.1     6 225     105  2.76 3.46  20.22     1     0     3     1\n 7  14.3     8 360     245  3.21 3.57  15.84     0     0     3     4\n 8  24.4     4 146.7    62  3.69 3.19  20        1     0     4     2\n 9  22.8     4 140.8    95  3.92 3.15  22.9      1     0     4     2\n10  19.2     6 167.6   123  3.92 3.44  18.3      1     0     4     4\n# ℹ 22 more rows",

Here are a few functions we are going to review in this lecture:\n\nselect(): keep or remove certain columns\n\n\nSubsetting with select()\nselect() allows you to keep or remove columns. For example, in the housingdata dataset, say we only want the columns name and city. We use the select function where the first argument is the name of the tibble, and the other arguments are the names of the columns we wish to keep:\n\nselect(housingdata, name, city)\n\n# A tibble: 8 × 2\n  name   city     \n  &lt;chr&gt;  &lt;chr&gt;    \n1 Grace  Vancouver\n2 Mei    Toronto  \n3 Steven Halifax  \n4 Phuong Vancouver\n5 Omar   Montreal \n6 Richa  Victoria \n7 Bruce  Halifax  \n8 David  Vancouver\n\n\nNow, this didn’t alter the original data frame!

We can see that housingdata still contains all of the information from the original data set.\n\nhousingdata\n\n# A tibble: 8 × 5\n  name   numrooms rent_2024 rent_2025 city     \n  &lt;chr&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;    \n1 Grace         2      2665      2700 Vancouver\n2 Mei           3      4900      5000 Toronto  \n3 Steven        1      2900      2900 Halifax  \n4 Phuong        4      4950      5000 Vancouver\n5 Omar          2      2400      2500 Montreal \n6 Richa         1      1000      1000 Victoria \n7 Bruce         3      2800      2800 Halifax  \n8 David         2      2350      2400 Vancouver\n\n\nWe can also use select() to indicate which columns to remove. For example, if I wanted all variables except name in my data set, I could do:\n\nselect(housingdata, -name)\n\n# A tibble: 8 × 4\n  numrooms rent_2024 rent_2025 city     \n     &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;    \n1        2      2665      2700 Vancouver\n2        3      4900      5000 Toronto  \n3        1      2900      2900 Halifax  \n4        4      4950      5000 Vancouver\n5        2      2400      2500 Montreal \n6        1      1000      1000 Victoria \n7        3      2800      2800 Halifax  \n8        2      2350      2400 Vancouver\n\n\n\n\nSubsetting with filter()\nThe filter() function allows you to specify which rows to keep in the tibble. The filter() function takes conditional statements and allows us to remove or keep rows based on these conditions.\nFor example, let’s say we wanted to keep only data where the rent in 2025 (rent_2025) is strictly larger than 2500. Then, we could use:\n\nfilter(housingdata, rent_2025 &gt; 2500)\n\n# A tibble: 5 × 5\n  name   numrooms rent_2024 rent_2025 city     \n  &lt;chr&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;    \n1 Grace         2      2665      2700 Vancouver\n2 Mei           3      4900      5000 Toronto  \n3 Steven        1      2900      2900 Halifax  \n4 Phuong        4      4950      5000 Vancouver\n5 Bruce         3      2800      2800 Halifax  \n\n\nNow, only rows with rent_2025 &gt; 2500 are kept in the data frame.\nWe can also use the == sign to indicate that something is equivalent. For example, we may only be interested in observations in Vancouver. To do so, we can use:\n\nfilter(housingdata, city == \"Vancouver\")\n\n# A tibble: 3 × 5\n  name   numrooms rent_2024 rent_2025 city     \n  &lt;chr&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;    \n1 Grace         2      2665      2700 Vancouver\n2 Phuong        4      4950      5000 Vancouver\n3 David         2      2350      2400 Vancouver\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe double == in the statement to indicate “is equal to”! Further, as the variable of interest is a string (or character type), we need to use quotations around the city name “Vancouver”.\n\n\nWe can also filter on multiple variables at the same time, even if they are different types. for example:\n\nfilter(housingdata, rent_2025 &gt; 2500, city == \"Vancouver\")\n\n# A tibble: 2 × 5\n  name   numrooms rent_2024 rent_2025 city     \n  &lt;chr&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;    \n1 Grace         2      2665      2700 Vancouver\n2 Phuong        4      4950      5000 Vancouver\n\n\n\n\nLeveling Up with tidyselect()\nSometimes we will want to select columns that have something in common with their name. This is particularly useful when the number of columns is large (for example, think if we had historical rent data for many years). To do so, we can use helper functions in the tidyverse library. First, install (if necessary) and load in the tidyverse library\n\n# install.packages(\"tidyverse\")\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\nLet’s use the starts_with() function to select all columns that relate to rents. We can do this by:\n\nselect(housingdata, starts_with(\"rent\"))\n\n# A tibble: 8 × 2\n  rent_2024 rent_2025\n      &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;\n1      2665      2700\n2      4900      5000\n3      2900      2900\n4      4950      5000\n5      2400      2500\n6      1000      1000\n7      2800      2800\n8      2350      2400\n\n\nThis code returned a tibble where only the columns involving rents are included! Other useful helper functions include:\n\nstarts_with() finds variables that start with the given input\nends_with() finds variables that end with the given input\ncontains() finds variables that have the given input at any location in the name\n\nWhile for the example data set we are really only selecting two columns, using these functions allows your code to be more flexible as data may be added later for more years of rent, for example.\n\n\nCreating New Variables with mutate()\nSometimes we need to create another variable or column based on information already present in a tibble. For example, suppose we are interested in the cost per room, rather than total rent, in our data. We can create a new variable that is the rent divided by the number of rooms using mutate():\n\nmutate(housingdata, rent_per_room_2025 = rent_2025/numrooms)\n\n# A tibble: 8 × 6\n  name   numrooms rent_2024 rent_2025 city      rent_per_room_2025\n  &lt;chr&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;                  &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 Grace         2      2665      2700 Vancouver         1350      \n2 Mei           3      4900      5000 Toronto           1666.6667 \n3 Steven        1      2900      2900 Halifax           2900      \n4 Phuong        4      4950      5000 Vancouver         1250      \n5 Omar          2      2400      2500 Montreal          1250      \n6 Richa         1      1000      1000 Victoria          1000      \n7 Bruce         3      2800      2800 Halifax            933.33333\n8 David         2      2350      2400 Vancouver         1200      \n\n\nWe can also clean this up by rounding our new variable to two decimal places using the round() function:\n\nmutate(housingdata, rent_per_room_2025 = round(rent_2025/numrooms,2))\n\n# A tibble: 8 × 6\n  name   numrooms rent_2024 rent_2025 city      rent_per_room_2025\n  &lt;chr&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;                  &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 Grace         2      2665      2700 Vancouver            1350   \n2 Mei           3      4900      5000 Toronto              1666.67\n3 Steven        1      2900      2900 Halifax              2900   \n4 Phuong        4      4950      5000 Vancouver            1250   \n5 Omar          2      2400      2500 Montreal             1250   \n6 Richa         1      1000      1000 Victoria             1000   \n7 Bruce         3      2800      2800 Halifax               933.33\n8 David         2      2350      2400 Vancouver            1200   \n\n\nAs we can see, the mutate() function took the data as the first argument, and then we listed the new variable name rent_per_room_2025 which we calculated by taking the rent in 2025 (rent_2025) and dividing it by the number of rooms in the house (numrooms). We wrapped round( x, 2) around the calculation to clean up the answer to two decimal places.\n\n\nThe Pipe Operator %&gt;%\nThe pipe operator (%&gt;%) is a convenient way to form a chain of commands on a tibble to perform multiple tasks at once.\nLet’s assume we want to modify a tibble using both select() and filter(). We can do so in one single line of code using the pipe operator. But for now, let’s start simple and use just one function using %&gt;%.\nLet’s say we want to subset our data and select only the rent and city columns on a tibble. We could use:\n\nselect(housingdata, starts_with(\"rent\"), city)\n\n# A tibble: 8 × 3\n  rent_2024 rent_2025 city     \n      &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;    \n1      2665      2700 Vancouver\n2      4900      5000 Toronto  \n3      2900      2900 Halifax  \n4      4950      5000 Vancouver\n5      2400      2500 Montreal \n6      1000      1000 Victoria \n7      2800      2800 Halifax  \n8      2350      2400 Vancouver\n\n\nwhich is a perfectly valid answer. However, we could also use the pipe operator, as:\n\nhousingdata %&gt;%\n  select(starts_with(\"rent\"), city)\n\n# A tibble: 8 × 3\n  rent_2024 rent_2025 city     \n      &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;    \n1      2665      2700 Vancouver\n2      4900      5000 Toronto  \n3      2900      2900 Halifax  \n4      4950      5000 Vancouver\n5      2400      2500 Montreal \n6      1000      1000 Victoria \n7      2800      2800 Halifax  \n8      2350      2400 Vancouver\n\n\nHere, we tell dplyr the tibble we want to transform (housingdata), and then use the pipe operator (%&gt;%) to tell dplyr what functions we want to perform on it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nWhen using the pipe operator, we no longer need to include the dataframe in the first argument of the function. Compare the previous two code chunks to see what I mean.\n\n\nWhile it may not be obvious from this first example why the pipe operator is commonly used, let’s consider that we want to\n\nfilter on rents for 2025 above $2500\nselect all columns aside from name\ncreate a new variable for the rent per room in 2025 (rounded to 2 decimal places)\nreorder the rows by descending order of 2025 rents\n\nThe arrange() function can change the order of rows.\narrange(desc(column_name)) will arrange the rows in descending order for the column_name given. See more here!\n\n\nTo do all of these tasks, the pipe operator allows us to write clear and readable code:\n\nhousingdata %&gt;% \n  filter(rent_2025 &gt; 2500) %&gt;%\n  select(-name) %&gt;%\n  mutate(rent_per_room_2025 = round(rent_2025/numrooms,2)) %&gt;%\n  arrange(desc(rent_2025))\n\n# A tibble: 5 × 5\n  numrooms rent_2024 rent_2025 city      rent_per_room_2025\n     &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;                  &lt;dbl&gt;\n1        3      4900      5000 Toronto              1666.67\n2        4      4950      5000 Vancouver            1250   \n3        1      2900      2900 Halifax              2900   \n4        3      2800      2800 Halifax               933.33\n5        2      2665      2700 Vancouver            1350   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nAfter each function call, we need to include the pipe operator to tell dplyr that we’re not done yet, and the chain of commands continues on the next line.\n\n\nAnother thing to note is that the pipe operator creates a new tibble and does not alter the original. So, housingdata still contains all of the original rows and columns in its unaltered form. If we wanted to alter it (or save the output to a new variable), we need to assign it using &lt;-. For example, the following code will overwrite the original tibble:\n\nhousingdata &lt;- housingdata %&gt;% \n    filter(rent_2025 &gt; 2500) %&gt;%\n    select(-name) %&gt;%\n    mutate(rent_per_room_2025 = round(rent_2025/numrooms, digits = 2)) %&gt;%\n    arrange(desc(rent_2025))\n\nhousingdata\n\n# A tibble: 5 × 5\n  numrooms rent_2024 rent_2025 city      rent_per_room_2025\n     &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;                  &lt;dbl&gt;\n1        3      4900      5000 Toronto              1666.67\n2        4      4950      5000 Vancouver            1250   \n3        1      2900      2900 Halifax              2900   \n4        3      2800      2800 Halifax               933.33\n5        2      2665      2700 Vancouver            1350",

    "text": "Exercise 1: Make a Function (25 points)\nIn this exercise, you’ll be making a function and fortifying it. The function need not be complicated. The function need not be “serious”, but shouldn’t be nonsense.\nFunction Ideas\n\nDid you repeat any code for a data analysis in STAT 545A? If so, consider making a function for this action.\nConsider bundling a specific group_by() %&gt;% summarise() workflow.\nWrite a wrapper around an existing function.\n\nFor example, perhaps accepting a narrower range of inputs (like not allowing logical vectors), or providing a different output.\nA specific example: the rqdist() function is a wrapper around quantreg::rq(), narrowing its functionality.\nIt’s usually better to narrow a function’s focus than to broaden, so that a function doesn’t end up doing too much.\n\nMake a special plot that you’d want to repeat when exploring your data.\n…\n\nGuidelines\n\nYour function should not rely on anything from your working environment.\nYour function should not rely on “magic numbers” – pre-selected numbers (or options) that appear inside the function that can’t be accessed by a user of the function.\n\nFor example, maybe quantile(x, type = 1, ...) appears in your function. The choice of 1 is arbitrary – unless you’re making a function like quantile_type_1().\n\nYour function should be reasonably flexible on its inputs. Here is an example of a function that is not reasonably flexible: a function called count_missing_values_by_group() that only works when the data frame has columns that are all of type fct.\nThe output is consistent – for example, always gives a list. An example of inconsistent output: sapply(1:3, seq_len) gives a list, and sapply(1:3, sqrt) gives an (atomic) vector.\nYour function includes appropriate arguments. (Do you handle NA’s appropriately? Are you using the ellipsis properly? etc.)",

    "text": "Feature ideas\nThere are countless possibilities for features, but here are just a few ideas. You can choose any 3 or more ideas from this list or do anything else! Want more ideas than what’s below? Check this out.\nWhile (this year) you will be developing your own Shiny app from scratch instead of building on the BC Liquor App developed in Dean Attali’s tutorial, we will use the BC Liquor App as a running example of feature ideas for concreteness.\n\nIf you have a table in your app…\n\nAdd an option to sort the table by one of your variables. For example, in the BC Liquor App, sorting the results by price.\n\nHint: Use checkboxInput() to get TRUE/FALSE values from the user.\n\nUse the DT package to turn a static table into an interactive table.\n\nHint: Install the DT package, replace tableOutput() with DT::dataTableOutput() and replace renderTable() with DT::renderDataTable().\n\nShow the number of results found whenever the filters change. For example, in the BC Liquor app, when searching for Italian wines $20 - $40, show the text “We found 122 options for you”.\n\nHint: Add a textOutput() to the UI, and in its corresponding renderText() use the number of rows in the filtered() object.\n\nAllow the user to download your table as a .csv file.\n\nHint: Look into the downloadButton() and downloadHandler() functions.\n\nAllow the user to search for multiple entries simultaneously; for example, in the BC Liquor app, allow the user to search for multiple alcohol types at once instead of wine/beer/etc, one at a time.\n\nHint: There are two approaches to do this. Either change the typeInput radio buttons into checkboxes (checkboxGroupInput()) since checkboxes support choosing multiple items, or change typeInput into a select box (selectInput()) with the argument multiple = TRUE to support choosing multiple options.\n\n\n\n\nIf you have a plot in your app…\n\nAdd parameters to the plot.\n\nHint: You will need to add input functions that will be used as parameters for the plot. You could use shinyjs::colourInput() to let the user decide on the colours of the bars in the plot.\n\n\n\n\nOther ideas:\n\nAdd an image to the UI. For example, in the BC Liquor app, add an image of the BC Liquor Store. If you’re building your own app from scratch, an image may make your app more visually interesting or add information!\n\nHint: Place the image in a folder named www, and use img(src = \"imagename.png\") to add the image.\n\nIf you know CSS, add CSS to make your app look nicer.\n\nHint: Add a CSS file under www and use the function includeCSS() to use it in your app.\n\nExperiment with packages that add extra features to Shiny, such as shinyjs, leaflet, shinydashboard, shinythemes, ggvis.\n\nHint: Each package is unique and has a different purpose, so you need to read the documentation of each package in order to know what it provides and how to use it.\n\nIf you have both a plot and a table, place them in separate tabs.\n\nHint: Use tabsetPanel() to create an interface with multiple tabs."

Specifically, write a sentence per feature explaining how it is useful. (60 pts, 20 per feature)\nWhat are we looking for in your features?\n\nVariety. Including three tables as part of your dashboard and having the same exact feature for each of them (e.g. a filtering option, even if the tables are distinct) will be penalized; at least 2 of the 3 features must be unique.\nWe will also evaluate the usefulness of your features in the context of your app (does it add to the user experience?). We expect your features to be sensible, meaning that they add to the user experience in a way that makes sense - as an example, adding a filtering option for “country” in a table that only has data for Canada does not seem very useful, even if you added the filtering feature correctly. If we consider any of your features to be irrelevant for the app, 2 pts will be penalized for that particular feature.\n\nRRR (15 pts):\n\nCode runs without errors and it is appropriately annotated, legible, and easy to follow. (8 pts)\nYour app should be deployed online on shinyapps.io (or on another server if you’d like). Make sure your app actually works online (sometimes your app will work in RStudio but will have errors on shinyapps.io - make sure you deploy early and often to make debugging easier). (7 pts)\n\n\n\n\nTidy Submission (25 points)\nFollow these steps to submit your work. Be sure to familiarize yourself with the rubric for a tidy submission below, before doing these steps.\n\n(20 pts) Make a README for your repository. The README must include:\n\nA link to a running instance of your Shiny app.\nA description of your app.\nWhatever dataset you will use, acknowledge its source clearly. Remember that we value open, reproducible science: this means that the user of your app should have direct access to the data, or know where to go to access it.\n\n(5 pts) Tag a release in your assignment repository.\nSubmit a link to your tagged release in your assignment repository to canvas. Make sure the TAs and Katie can see your repository! Either it should be public or private with TAs and Katie added as collaborators."

(So that you capture your work within the branch.)\n\nYou can do this either on GitHub, or on your own computer using RStudio.\n\nMake changes to some files on the new branch.\n\nYou can do this either on GitHub or on your own computer (locally), but if you do this locally, you’ll need to remember to push your work (on the branch) to GitHub.\n\nStart a pull request on GitHub, by going to “Pull Requests” -&gt; “New Pull Request”, and selecting the branch you intend to merge to the main branch. In your pull request, include a comment and title indicating (at a high level) what this change you made is about.\n\n\nIn the comments, include some indication as to which teammate will be responsible for checking and merging the new work contained in the pull request.\n\nPerhaps you’ve already decided up front who will be reviewing who’s work.\nOr perhaps (and more realistically), in your comment, you may ask the group at large who would like to volunteer, and then someone will respond.\nHow you work this out should go in your teamwork document (as described in another exercise).\n\nThe teammate responsible for reviewing and merging the pull request does so, being sure to add to the discussion happening in the pull request by adding a comment.\n\nThe comment could be as simple as something like “I’ve reviewed these changes, and everything looks great.” Or, it could highlight some issues that were found, in which case the team should work towards resolving the issue.\n\n\nHere are some ideas of things you can merge:\n\nYour initial draft of the README document or TEAMWORK document.\nYour changes to the troubleshooting exercise.\nModifications to any document.\n\nNote 1: Work together as a team to get this done. If one of your teammates is having trouble with this procedure, help them out! Sometimes a merge conflict will happen, and it’s best to work as a team to figure out how to resolve these issues.\nNote 2: Please indicate to the TAs which Pull Requests you would like to be graded by adding “(GRADED)” to the PR name. Every team member should have exactly one pull request labelled “(GRADED)”.\nGrading:\n\n4 points awarded for the creation of a complete set of pull requests (i.e., one pull request per teammate).\n14 points awarded for the successful merging of a complete set of pull requests.\n4 points awarded for the comment(s) kicking off the pull request.\n4 points awarded for the follow-up comment(s) from a reviewer.\n4 points awarded if each teammate gets the chance to act as a reviewer/merger of someone else’s pull request.\nPenalty of up to 4 points if the total amount of work contained in pull requests does not amount to much. We just want to make sure that, when you’re working on this project, you’re largely working on branches. It’s OK to commit directly to the main branch without a pull request, but this should be the exception, not the norm.\nPenalty of 1 point if you have not indicated to the TAs which PRs you would like to be graded by adding “(GRADED)” to the PR name.",

Click that.\n\n\nYou might also be able to get to the same place by clicking on the “tags” link beside where your branches are listed.\n\n\nFor the tag version, put m1.0 (for “milestone 1.0”).\n\n\nChoose a release title and description (this is less important).\nDo not check off “This is a pre-release”.\nClick “Publish Release”.\nPut a link to that release as a submission on the Collaborative Project Milestone 1\n\nYou won’t lose marks for not submitting your link to canvas, but it would really help us out if you do this! Thank you!\n\n\nIf you want to “re-tag” your release:\nIf you want to change your submission after tagging a release, you can still do this if it’s before the deadline. Just increase the secondary version number by one – so, make the tag version m1.1, then m1.2, etc.\nGrading: 2 points awarded for tagging a release.",

Any changes will be announced via the #annoucements channel on Slack, and major changes will be sent out via email.\n\n\nAssessments\nThis course will have autograded worksheets meant to guide you through a number of exercises as well as assignments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAssessment\nPercent Grade\nNote\n\n\n\n\nWorksheets\n15%\nThree guided worksheets\n\n\nAssignments\n85%\nThree assignments involving more independent analyses and tasks\n\n\n\n\nWorksheets\nWorksheets are interactive assignments that allow students to get real-time feedback on their code. Your grade will be based on the number of correct answers provided. There are unlimited attempts for the worksheets, and time will be given in class to work through them. Worksheets are equally weighted (each worth 5% of your final grade).\nWorksheets are produced with Jupyter Notebooks, and will be submitted on Canvas.\n\n\n\nWorksheet\nRelease Date\nDue Date (11:59PM PT)\n\n\n\n\nWorksheet B1\nMonday Oct 20, 2025\nMonday Oct 27, 2025\n\n\nWorksheet B2\nFriday Nov 14, 2025\nMonday Nov 24, 2025\n\n\nWorksheet B3\nTuesday Nov 25, 2025\nThursday Dec 4, 2025\n\n\n\n\n\nAssignments\nThere are four formal assignments for this course, each equally weighted (each worth 21.25% of your final grade):\n\n\n\nAssignment\nRelease Date\nDue Date (11:59pm PT)\n\n\n\n\nAssignment 1\nTuesday Oct 21, 2025\nTuesday Nov 4, 2025\n\n\nAssignment 2\nTuesday Nov 4, 2025\nTuesday Nov 18, 2025\n\n\nAssignment 3\nThursday Nov 18, 2025\nThursday Dec 4, 2025\n\n\n\nInstructions will be posted on the Course Website under “Assignments (Part B)”\n\n\n\nAuditing Students\nAuditing students are expected to complete all assessments (see above). All assessments are graded on a pass/fail basis for those officially auditing.\nYou must be registered as an auditing student to attend lectures due to capacity limitations.\n\n\nCourse Communications\nWe will be using Slack as our primary platform of all course-related communications! Students will be emailed an invite to their class’ Slack workspace.\nOfficial course communications will occur on the #announcements channel. You will receive an invite on the first day of classes. Please notify the instructor by email if you have not received your personal invite.\nOur STAT 545 team will be actively monitoring Slack during regular working hours (9am to 5pm PT, Monday to Friday). You are free to ask questions outside of this window but please keep in mind that there are no expectations for the team to answer questions outside of working hours or on weekends or holidays.\nTo make the most out of Slack, please\n\nUse the #general channel for clarifications, asking about course organization, or clarifying instructions. Things you post on the #general channel will be seen by everyone, so please do not provide information that gives away answers to assignments.\nMake a group chat with our TAs when you need more personalized help, or have an issue with grading. They may direct you to the #general channel when appropriate, or direct you to the instructor.\nDirect message the instructor if there is a concern that is more personal (i.e., you need to self declare an absense) or if you have already talked to the TAs about an issue and are unsatisfied. You can also direct message the instructor if you are having issues with a group member in any group-related assignments.\nPost in the #random channel if you find things related to the course that you’d like to share\n\n\n\nPrivacy\nSlack and GitHub are hosted on servers stored outside of Canada. Please keep this in mind.\n\n\nPolicies\n\nRegrade Requests\nRegrade requests must be sent to the TAs through Slack within one week of the assessment being returned. If required, regrade requests can be escalated to the instructor only if the request has already been brought up to the TA team and the student is unsatisfied. The instructor reserves the right to regrade the entire assessment, resulting in a higher or lower mark than originally provided.\n\n\nLate Policies\nWorksheets (and larger assignments, if applicable) are due at 11:59pm PT on the date indicated in the course schedule. For a late submission, a 24 hour extension will be provided for the first offense. Late submissions will be given a grade of 0 for subsequent occurrences.\nThere is a zero-tolerance policy for late projects, including the mini data analysis and the collaborative project. If you are having issues with a team member regarding any group work, reach out to the instructor directly through Slack or email.\n\n\nAcademic Concession\nUBC no longer requires a doctor’s note (or supporting documentation) for academic concession. A self-declaration will suffice – here is a template you can use. The form is also posted on our Canvas page. Please submit this to the instructor via email.\nExamples of “conflicting responsibility” are conference travel and time-sensitive field work.\nIf you arrange to have an assignment submitted late, you may not be able to receive feedback from your peers.\n\n\nPlagiarism\nPlagiarism, which is intellectual theft, occurs where an individual submits or presents the oral or written work of another person as his or her own and can include:\n\nmultiple students submitting the same response\ncopying from sources without citing them\ncopying verbatim (word-for-word) from source and citing, but failing to make it explicit that this is a quotation (quotations should be used only rarely, if at all)\n\nStudents are responsible for ensuring that any work submitted does not constitute plagiarism. Students who are in any doubt as to what constitutes plagiarism should consult their instructor before handing in any assignments.\nFor more information see the UBC Academic Misconduct policies.\n\n\nCode Plagiarism\nStudents must correctly cite any code that has been authored by someone else or by the student themselves for other assignments. Cases of code plagiarism may include, but are not limited to:\n\nthe reproduction (copying and pasting) of code with none or minimal reformatting (e.g., changing the name of the variables)\nthe translation of an algorithm or a script from a language to another\nthe generation of code by automatic code-generations software\n\nAn “adequate acknowledgement” requires a detailed identification of the (parts of the) code reused and a full citation of the original source code that has been reused.\n\n\nUBC’s Policies and Resources to Support Student Success\nUBC provides resources to support student learning and to maintain healthy lifestyles but recognizes that sometimes crises arise and so there are additional resources to access including those for survivors of sexual violence. UBC values respect for the person and ideas of all members of the academic community. Harassment and discrimination are not tolerated nor is suppression of academic freedom. UBC provides appropriate accommodation for students with disabilities and for religious, spiritual and cultural observances. UBC values academic honesty and students are expected to acknowledge the ideas generated by others and to uphold the highest academic standards in all of their actions. Details of the policies and how to access support are available here.\n\n\nYour personal health\nIf you’re sick, it’s important that you stay home – no matter what you think you may be sick with (e.g., cold, flu, other). Your precautions will help reduce risk and keep everyone safer. The structure of this class is intended to provide flexibility so that you can prioritize your health and still be able to succeed.\nIf you do miss class because of illness:\n\nConsult the class resources on the course website\nCome to office hours on Zoom.\nUse Slack to carry out discussions.\n\nIf you miss an assessment due to illness, see the above section on Academic Concessions, and review the UBC policy here: http://www.calendar.ubc.ca/vancouver/index.cfm?tree=3,329,0,0\nAbove all, please take care of yourself and be kind to yourself and your classmates. If you or anyone you know experiences any academic stress, difficult life events, or feelings like anxiety or depression, I strongly encourage you to seek support. UBC Counseling Services is here to help: call 604 822 3811 or visit their website. Consider also reaching out to a friend, faculty member, or family member you trust to help get you the support you need.\n\n\nInstructor health\nIf I am ill, then I will not come to class. If that happens, here’s what you can expect:\n\nIf I am well enough to teach, I will conduct virtual lectures through Zoom until I am well. If this happens, you will be tagged in an announcement via Slack with information. You can anticipate that this would very likely be a last minute announcement. Our classroom will still be available for you to sit and attend an online session, although it is recommended that you bring headphones.\nIf I am not well enough to teach, it is possible that one or more teaching assistants will take my place. But if not, we will either try to make up for lost time, make new resources to aid in your learning, or make accommodations regarding the assessments.\n\n\n\n\nCopyright\nCourse materials are licensed under Creative Commons 4.0.\n\n\n\n\n Back to top",

    "text": "Why Automation\nIt often makes sense to break up a task (e.g. “analyze data and turn it into publication ready figures and tables”) into smaller chunks, e.g. “data cleaning” vs “summarizing and plotting” vs “model fitting”. This leads to a pipeline: a system where the code for some tasks (e.g. summarizing and plotting) depend on the output of others (e.g. data cleaning).\nOne of the major advantages to this paradigm: you no longer have to re-run all of the code every time you make a change. You only need to run the parts downstream from what you changed.\nBut how do we keep track of what needs to be re-run when we make changes in this system? We could do it by hand, but this is likely to cause human error (recall the reproducibility principle!). It’s much safer to automate. We will be learning how to use Makefiles for this purpose.\nThis will be challenging! But the payoff is huge for larger projects. Shaun Jackman gives an example of a Bioinformatics paper that is generated with a single Makefile that:\n\nDownloads the data\nRuns command-line programs\nPerforms the statistical analyses using R\nGenerates TSV tables\nRenders figures using ggplot2\nRenders supplementary material using RMarkdown\nRenders the manuscript using Pandoc\n\nAnd critically, knows which parts need to be run and which parts do not. Amazing, right?"

    "text": "Working with Strings\nOur main tools for working with strings will be the powerful stringr package in the tidyverse paired with regular expressions (also called regex).\nWe’ll be going through a few examples with the enron dataset, which you can download on Github. Enron is a database of 270,087 Enron emails, taken from the May 7, 2015 version of the dataset. Data was extracted from CMU. There are three columns in enron.csv:\n\nperson: The person associated with the email.\nmail_num: Identifier for each person’s email.\nemail: Each entry is a line in an email, including the email’s metadata (like subject, who it was sent to, etc.)\n\nLet’s load in the data:\n\nenron &lt;- read_csv(\"datasets/enron.csv\")\nhead(enron)\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 3\n  mail_num person  email                                                    \n     &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;   &lt;chr&gt;                                                    \n1        1 allen-p Message-ID: &lt;18782981.1075855378110.JavaMail.evans@thyme&gt;\n2        1 allen-p Date: Mon, 14 May 2001 16:39:00 -0700 (PDT)              \n3        1 allen-p From: phillip.allen@enron.com                            \n4        1 allen-p To: tim.belden@enron.com                                 \n5        1 allen-p Subject:                                                 \n6        1 allen-p Mime-Version: 1.0                                        \n\n\nFor each email sent in this data set (mail_num), we have the sender (person) along with the lines of the email in separate entries in the data frame (email). For now, we’ll focus on the contents of the email, in the email column.\n\nenron_email &lt;- enron$email\n\n\nNon-regex String Manipulation\nWe’ll first go through some stringr functions that don’t require regular expressions.\n\nstr_detech() and str_subset()\nLet’s filter only on entries that contain emails. We can do this by calling str_detect() and finding entries that contain “From:”:\n\nenron_email_at&lt;- str_detect(enron_email, \"@\") # find all entries with \"@\" in the email column\n\nhead(enron_email_at)\n\n[1]  TRUE FALSE  TRUE  TRUE FALSE FALSE\n\n\nstr_detect actually returns a logical vector showing whether or not “@” was found in the email contents! To get the subset, we can use str_subset():\n\nenron_email_at &lt;- str_subset(enron_email, \"@\") #overwrite:\nhead(enron_email_at)\n\n[1] \"Message-ID: &lt;18782981.1075855378110.JavaMail.evans@thyme&gt;\"\n[2] \"From: phillip.allen@enron.com\"                            \n[3] \"To: tim.belden@enron.com\"                                 \n[4] \"X-To: Tim Belden &lt;Tim Belden/Enron@EnronXGate&gt;\"           \n[5] \"Message-ID: &lt;15464986.1075855378456.JavaMail.evans@thyme&gt;\"\n[6] \"From: phillip.allen@enron.com\"                            \n\n\n\n\nstr_split()\nLet’s say we wanted to count the number of times the word “important” was written in an email. To do this, we can split every email line into its individual words using the str_split() function. Let’s split by spaces to get each individual word.\n\nenron_email_words &lt;- str_split(enron_email, \" \")\n\nhead(enron_email_words)\n\n[[1]]\n[1] \"Message-ID:\"                                  \n[2] \"&lt;18782981.1075855378110.JavaMail.evans@thyme&gt;\"\n\n[[2]]\n[1] \"Date:\"    \"Mon,\"     \"14\"       \"May\"      \"2001\"     \"16:39:00\" \"-0700\"   \n[8] \"(PDT)\"   \n\n[[3]]\n[1] \"From:\"                   \"phillip.allen@enron.com\"\n\n[[4]]\n[1] \"To:\"                  \"tim.belden@enron.com\"\n\n[[5]]\n[1] \"Subject:\"\n\n[[6]]\n[1] \"Mime-Version:\" \"1.0\"          \n\n\nWe get a list! This is because we don’t know how many words each entry will contain, so a list is the most flexible option. If we really wanted a vector of all of the individual words (which, we do!), we can unlist() the list:\n\nenron_email_words &lt;- unlist(enron_email_words)\n\nhead(enron_email_words)\n\n[1] \"Message-ID:\"                                  \n[2] \"&lt;18782981.1075855378110.JavaMail.evans@thyme&gt;\"\n[3] \"Date:\"                                        \n[4] \"Mon,\"                                         \n[5] \"14\"                                           \n[6] \"May\"                                          \n\n\nNow, we can subset by which words contain “important”, and count the number of entries!\n\n\nenron_emails_important &lt;- str_subset(enron_email_words, \"important\")\nlength(enron_emails_important)\n\n[1] 91\n\n\n91 times! But unfortunately, str_subset() is case sensitive… See:\n\nenron_emails_important &lt;- str_subset(enron_email_words, \"Important\")\nlength(enron_emails_important)\n\n[1] 9\n\n\nand..\n\nenron_emails_important &lt;- str_subset(enron_email_words, \"IMPORTANT\")\nlength(enron_emails_important)\n\n[1] 5\n\n\nThis is where regular expressions come in handy! We’ll discuss this in the following section.\n\n\n\nRegular Expressions (regex)\nRegular expressions provide a powerful tool to extract character data through patterns! In regexes, specific characters and constructs take on special meaning in order to match multiple strings.\nWe will go through a few common regex special characters, but refer readers to this Cheat Sheet by Ian Kopacka for a more in-depth review.\nLet’s consider a simple vector of words:\n\n\nwords &lt;- c(\"bat\", \"cat\", \"5at\", \"rats\", \"?at\", \"kittycat\", \"doormats\", \"attic\", \"matchstick\", \"hat-trick\", \"hattrick\", \"hat trick\")\n\n\n. (match any letter)\nThe . in regex allows us to match any character (i.e., a number, letter, symbol (aside from a new line)) in an expression.\nFor example, the pattern .at would match any word that has at least three characters, where we have some character followed by “at”.\n\nstr_subset(words, pattern = \".at\")\n\n [1] \"bat\"        \"cat\"        \"5at\"        \"rats\"       \"?at\"       \n [6] \"kittycat\"   \"doormats\"   \"matchstick\" \"hat-trick\"  \"hattrick\"  \n[11] \"hat trick\" \n\n\n\n\n$, ^ (anchors)\nAnchors can be included in an expression to indicate where the expression must occur in a string. ^ indicates that the string must start with the phrase, and $ indicates the string must end with it.\n\nstr_subset(words, pattern = \"^.at\")\n\n[1] \"bat\"        \"cat\"        \"5at\"        \"rats\"       \"?at\"       \n[6] \"matchstick\" \"hat-trick\"  \"hattrick\"   \"hat trick\" \n\n\nNotice how we did not select “attic”,“kittycat” or “doormats”\n\nstr_subset(words, pattern = \".at$\")\n\n[1] \"bat\"      \"cat\"      \"5at\"      \"?at\"      \"kittycat\"\n\n\nNotice how we only selected words ending in &lt;some chatacter&gt;at.\n\n\n\\b and \\B (boundaries and not a word boundary)\n\\b indicates a word boundary, and \\B indicates NOT a word boundary. To see what we mean, see the following:\n\nstr_subset(words, pattern = \"\\\\btrick\")\n\n[1] \"hat-trick\" \"hat trick\"\n\n\nThis selected words that were separated by either a “-” or space.\n\nstr_subset(words, pattern = \"\\\\Btrick\")\n\n[1] \"hattrick\"\n\n\nThis selected words that did not have any separation between them.\n\n\n*, +, ? (quantifiers)\nWe can specify regex to match any number of characters\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuantifier\nNumber of Characters\nRange to Match\nMeaning\n\n\n\n\n*\n0 or more\n{n}\nexactly n\n\n\n+\n1 or more\n{n,}\nat least n\n\n\n?\n0 or 1\n{,m}\nat most m\n\n\n\n\n{n,m}\nbetween n and m, inclusive\n\n\n\nFor example, let’s match words that have 0 or more characters before “at”.\n\nstr_subset(words, pattern = \".*at\")\n\n [1] \"bat\"        \"cat\"        \"5at\"        \"rats\"       \"?at\"       \n [6] \"kittycat\"   \"doormats\"   \"attic\"      \"matchstick\" \"hat-trick\" \n[11] \"hattrick\"   \"hat trick\" \n\n\nAll of our words contain “at” somewhere so they are all matched. What about strictly one or more characters before “at”?\n\nstr_subset(words, pattern = \".+at\")\n\n [1] \"bat\"        \"cat\"        \"5at\"        \"rats\"       \"?at\"       \n [6] \"kittycat\"   \"doormats\"   \"matchstick\" \"hat-trick\"  \"hattrick\"  \n[11] \"hat trick\" \n\n\nAll but attic. Makes sense!\nWe can also match on specific letters. Let’s select words with one or more “o”’s in it:\n\nstr_subset(words, pattern = \"o+\")\n\n[1] \"doormats\"\n\n\nOf course, regular expressions can be combined together to make powerful search tools, as well. For more on regular expressions, check out Chapter 11 of the STAT545 Textbookand the STAT545 video lecture. We will also learn more as we work through Worksheet B2."

Instead of coding each step multiple times, let’s turn it into a function.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 1\n\n\n\nBy yourself or in small groups, try to turn the code above into a function called summarizeby_fun(). Document your code!\n\n\nWe will go over the solution in class.\n\n\nData-masking and the Curly-Curly {{}}\nSometimes your function needs to take in variable names without quotation marks and work with them that way.\nFor example, select(penguins, species) does not put quotation marks around lifeExp – the reasoning being that lifeExp is like a variable in our workspace, if we were to include column names in our R Environment – and select(\"penguins\", \"species\") will not do the same thing.\nIf your function needs to do this, then you need to work with the arguments with extra care inside the function definition. Whenever we use those arguments, we need to embrace them within two curly brackets – an operator called “curly curly”.\nTake this function that produces a quick scatterplot between two columns in a dataset as an example.\nquick_scatter &lt;- function(data, x, y) {\n  ggplot(data, aes(x, y)) + #note curly brackets here!\n     geom_point()\n}\n\nquick_scatter(penguins, bill_length_mm, body_mass_g)\nError in `geom_point()`:\n! Problem while computing aesthetics.\nℹ Error occurred in the 1st layer.\nCaused by error:\n! object 'bill_length_mm' not found\nWhy doesn’t this work? The reason is that R is looking for variables named bill_len and body_mass in the workspace, and cannot find them. To fix the problem, we can change the function definition so that `x` and `y` are embraced within two curly brackets {{}} (“curly curly”):\n\nquick_scatter &lt;- function(data, x, y) {\n  ggplot(data, aes({{ x }}, {{ y }})) + #note curly brackets here!\n     geom_point()\n}\n\nquick_scatter(penguins, bill_length_mm, body_mass_g)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut, you can only use curly-curly when passing your function’s argument to another function that’s anticipating a variable name without brackets.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nIn the `dplyr` documentation, if you spy the words “data masking” or “tidy selection”, then you will need to curly-curly your arguments when using those functions within your custom function.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 2\n\n\n\nMake a modification to our function summarizeby_fun(): allow the user to also pass in which variables they want to summarize. (Right now it just summarizes all of them.)\n\n\nWe will go over the solution in class.\n\n\nDefault Parameters\nRecall the dice-rolling example from the previous lecture. Sometimes you want to use a function frequently without re-writing the same parameters over and over again. Let’s make a more flexible function that allows us to change the number of faces on the dice being rolled.\n\n#' @details\n#' Simulates rolling `num_dice` number of dice with `n_sides` sides and outputs the sum. Note: no seed is used so the function will return a dice combination each time it is run\n#'\n#' @param num_dice integer representing number of dice to be rolled\n#' @param n_sides integer representing the number of sides of each dice\n#' @return the sum of the dice rolled\n  \nroll_dice &lt;- function(n_sides, num_dice) { \n  \n    # throw an error if num_dice (the input) is not an integer\n  \n    if(num_dice %% 1 != 0){ #if num_dice mod 1 is NOT 0\n      stop(\"num_dice must be an integer\") #throw this error message and stop the function\n    }\n  \n    #if the num_dice is an integer, continue with the function:\n    sum(sample(1:n_sides, num_dice, replace=TRUE)) #sample two numbers from one to n_sides with replacement, return sum\n}\n\nNotice now that in this function, there are two parameters (the new one is n_sides). We are also sampling from 1:nsides instead of 1:10 to make the function more flexible. I also renamed the function to roll_dice as we are not necessarily rolling d10 dice.\nSo to roll 2, 10-sided dice, I can call:\n\nroll_dice(n_sides = 10, num_dice = 2)\n\n[1] 10\n\n\nIf I wanted to make the default number of sides to 10, I can do that in the function()!\n\n#' @details\n#' Simulates rolling `num_dice` number of dice with `n_sides` sides and outputs the sum. Note: no seed is used so the function will return a dice combination each time it is run\n#'\n#' @param num_dice integer representing number of dice to be rolled\n#' @param n_sides integer representing the number of sides of each dice. Default is 10.\n#' @return the sum of the dice rolled\n  \nroll_dice &lt;- function(n_sides = 10, num_dice) { \n  \n    # throw an error if num_dice (the input) is not an integer\n  \n    if(num_dice %% 1 != 0){ #if num_dice mod 1 is NOT 0\n      stop(\"num_dice must be an integer\") #throw this error message and stop the function\n    }\n  \n    #if the num_dice is an integer, continue with the function:\n    sum(sample(1:n_sides, num_dice, replace=TRUE)) #sample two numbers from one to n_sides with replacement, return sum\n}\n\nWe have set n_sides = 10 as the default. This means the function will assume we have a 10 sided dice unless otherwise specified. Let’s roll 3 dice using 10 sided dice (the default):\n\nroll_dice(num_dice = 3)\n\n[1] 16\n\n\nI didn’t need to include n_sides = 10 in my function call! But I can if I want to change it to a number other than 10. Let’s roll 3 standard 6-sided dice\n\nroll_dice(n_sides = 6, num_dice = 3)\n\n[1] 12\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 3\n\n\n\nMake a new argument for the summarizeby_fun() we made previously called .groups that makes it default to dropping the groups in the output.\n\n\n\n\nEllipses (...)\nThe ellipses allow a function to accept a variable number of additional unnamed arguments beyond what is explicitly written in the function. Many built-in functions have ... listed (check out c()!)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstructor Demo\n\n\n\nWe’ll modify our function together using ellipses to get extra functionality: we’ll allow the user to group by more than one variable.\n\n\n\n\nHandling NAs\nMissing data is essentially inevitable. Few studies are able to collect 100% of the data they intend to.\nMissing data can heavily complicate analyses and even lead to biased results when not handled properly. Missing data is a big research area in statistics! But for this class, we are going to focus on dealing with missing data using a simple example.\nLet’s look at the flipper length of penguins in the penguins data set and count how many missing values there are using the is.na() function in R. is.na(flipper_len) will return a vector full of TRUE or FALSE values indicating whether or not the observation was missing. As TRUE is coded as a 1 and FALSE as a 0, we can sum over these to count how many missing values there are.\n\nflipper_len &lt;- penguins$flipper_length_mm #save this data as its own vector\nsum(is.na(flipper_len)) # count how many NAs there are in the flipper data\n\n[1] 2\n\n\nWe see we have two missing values. Let’s see if we can summarize the quantiles of the lengths:\nquantile(flipper_len)\nError in quantile.default(flipper_length) :\nmissing values and NaN's not allowed if 'na.rm' is FALSE\nWe see here that missing values are not allowed unless we specify na.rm = TRUE. When na.rm = TRUE, we remove missing values from the data and then calculate the quantiles. This is also referred to as a complete case analysis.\n\nquantile(flipper_len, na.rm = TRUE)\n\n  0%  25%  50%  75% 100% \n 172  190  197  213  231 \n\n\nNow suppose we wanted to make our own function that utilized the quantile() built-in function:\n\n#' @details\n#' calculates the range of data by finding the 100th and 0th quantile and finding their difference\n#'\n#' @param vec a vector that we want to find the range of\n#' @return the difference in the maximum and minimum\n  \nget_range &lt;- function(vec){\n  quantiles &lt;- quantile(vec, na.rm = TRUE) #calc quantiles, remove NA's\n  return(max(quantiles) - min(quantiles)) #calculate and return the range\n}\n\nget_range(flipper_len)\n\n[1] 59\n\n\nWe could also include na.rm in our function parameters to allow the user to specify whether or not it should be set to TRUE or FALSE. We can use a default, as well.\n\n#' @details\n#' calculates the range of data by finding the 100th and 0th quantile and finding their difference\n#'\n#' @param vec a vector that we want to find the range of\n#' @param na.rm logical, whether or not to remove NAs. Default set to TRUE.\n#' @return the difference in the maximum and minimum\n  \nget_range &lt;- function(vec, na.rm = TRUE){\n  quantiles &lt;- quantile(vec, na.rm = na.rm) #calc quantiles, remove NA's\n  return(max(quantiles) - min(quantiles)) #calculate and return the range\n}\n\nget_range(flipper_len) #default to true\n\n[1] 59\n\n\n\n\nAttribution\nSome of these notes were originally compiled by previous iterations of the instructional staff, including Vincenzo Coia.\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"

    "section": "Quarto Websites",
    "text": "Quarto Websites\nTurns out, you’ve been using a Quarto website this whole semester! Our STAT545 webpage (the one you’re on right now) was build entirely using Quarto. And, this was build using no prior Quarto knowledge or fancy tools - this was actually my first website build ever.\nLet’s “learn by doing” and build a webpage together! This is a great opportunity to build a professional website (like mine) using Quarto. We will host our website on Github to make things easy!\nBefore continuing, ensure that you’ve installed Quarto using the tutorial in the previous sections.\n\nInitial Website Set-up\nStep 1: In RStudio, create a New Project. Select “New Directory” and then find “Quarto Website”. If given an option for version control, select Git. A simple build of a two paged website will generate.\nStep 2: In the Terminal, run touch .nojekyll (Mac OS) or copy NUL .nojekyll to disable Jekyll.\nStep 3: Within the RStudio project, navigate to the _quarto.yml file in your files (right hand pane). Under the project: preamble, add output-dir: docs.\nStep 4: Navigate back to index.qmd. Save and click the Render button. A local version of this simple website will appear.\nNow, we should send this to GitHub so we can host our website on GitHub and make changes both locally and through GitHub. To do so, we need to connect this R Project with Github.\nStep 5: When you made this project, you should have selected to use Git as a version control. If not, head to Tools &gt; Version control &gt; Project Setup and select Git as your version control. At this time, origin should be set to none.\nStep 6: On GitHub, make a new EMPTY repository. This should be named with the same name as your website (i.e., yourname.github.io). Ensure you UNSELECT to make a README file.\nStep 7: Now back to RStudio. We will be working in the terminal to give commands to our computer to connect with Github.\n\nSAVE ALL FILES. In the Terminal (beside the Console in RStudio)\nRun git init\nRun git add .\nThen, commit the changes of our website to Git. Type git commit -m \"initial commit\"\n\nThe -m \"&lt;description&gt;\" part adds the &lt;description&gt; of your changes.\n\nNow we need to tell GitHub where we are pushing our changes to (i.e., the repository you just created!) using git remote add origin https://github.com/&lt;yourusername&gt;/&lt;yourreponame&gt; and filling in your username and repository name.\nPush the changes using git push -u origin main. Head back to github to see new files added to your repository.\n\nStep 8: See your new website\n\nOn Github in your repository, click the three dots and head to settings.\nNavigate to pages on the lefthand side menu.\nUnder branch, select main as your branch and /docs as the folder. Select save.\nGive it a few minutes and refresh if you don’t see a success message pointing to the website.\nHead to &lt;yourreponame&gt;.github.io to see if it worked!\n\nStep 9: Edit your website and push the changes\n\nEdit your version locally, and render and save.\nThen, in the terminal:\n\nRun git add .\nRun git commit -m \"&lt;description of your changes&gt;\"\nRun git push origin main\n\n\n\n\nGeneral tips\n\nSometime if you change a file name or remove it, Quarto will get confused. You can go to the docs folder and delete the old file name/file you deleted and re-render and save.\nTo re-render all documents, use quarto render in the Terminal. Then, save all. Do this before staging and committing changes to GitHub.\nUse folders to keep things organized.\nFor people less familiar with Markdown syntax, the “Visual” viewer is useful! It provides a more user-friendly IDE and buttons for things like titles, bold text, lists, links, images, formatting, and tables. It is directly below the Save button on RStudio. You can toggle between Source and Visual to see the Markdown version and a more visual version of your files."

You can see this in this section:\n      - href: index.qmd\n        text: Home\nNow that we’ve told Quarto where our homepage is, let’s update it.\n\n\nAdd a Headshot and Link your GitHub\nIt’s useful to add a headshot to your website! At this point if you don’t have a nice photo of yourself or are not comfortable adding one, just grab a stock image online of your favourite animal. (Side note: I’d recommend getting a professional headshot if you don’t have one! This is something on my own personal to-do list)\n\nCreate an images folder in your directory (same place as your index.qmd file), and save the image you’d like to display there. I’d recommend saving the image as avatar.png.\n\nWe will use the jolla template, which is provides a nice home page for personal websites. We’ll also add a link to your GitHub profile so people can see your projects.\nIn your files, you should see index.qmd. Do not rename this file! Quarto knows that this is your “home page”.\n\nOpen and edit the index.qmd file, and fill in the appropriate information indicated in &lt;&gt;:\n\n---\ntitle: \"&lt;Your Name&gt;\"\nabout:\n  template: jolla\n  image: images/avatar.png\n  links:\n    - icon: github\n      text: Github\n      href: https://github.com/&lt;yourgithubusername&gt;\n---\nThe stuff between the --- is called the Preamble, which builds the foundation of the webpage.\n\n\nAdd your Education\n\nLet’s add your position (Graduate Student in &lt;Department&gt;) in italics, and add our institution. This will be under our photo. Let’s add the following under our Preamble:\n\n*Graduate Student in &lt;Department&gt;*\n\nUniversity of British Columbia \nLet’s also make a subsection for a more detailed look at your education. Add your current and previous education under an Education header (feel free to add or remove lines):\n## Education\n\nDegree, School | Year\n\nDegree, School | Year\n\nDegree, School | Year\n\n\nCreate Another Page\nLet’s add another page that we can navigate to! First, let’s add a .qmd page to our directory. Click “File” &gt; “New File” &gt; “Quarto Document”. Add a title to your page, and keep all other defaults. We will be adding a page containing Courses we’ve taken at UBC as an example. An appropriate name could be simply “Courses”. We can update this later if needed.\nOpen the new file. Update the preamble to include the date at which the page was last modified:\n---\ntitle: \"Courses\"\ndate-modified: last-modified\n---\nNow, let’s add some information! It’s your turn to explore Quarto.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise: Add a Courses Page\n\n\n\n\nAdd a subsection (##) of your current courses\n\nAdd a list of courses you’re currently taking, and link them to the UBC course calendar descriptions or course website.\nHINT: try visual mode if you cannot remember how to write links or lists in Markdown\n\nAdd a subsection (##) for past courses\n\nAdd a list of some past courses you’re taken at UBC or another institution, and link them to the a course calendar descriptions or course website. Indicate what institution you took the courses at (i.e., STAT 200 (UBC))\n\n\n\n\nNow, the page is ready to add to our website. Open the _quarto.yml file and add courses.qmd to the list of webpages.\nwebsite:\n  title: \"&lt;Your Name&gt;\"\n  navbar:\n    left:\n      - href: index.qmd\n        text: Home\n      - courses.qmd\nHead back to courses.qmd, save all, and render. Do you see your new page in the navigation bar?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise: Add Another Page\n\n\n\nFollow the previous steps to add another page to your website. Here are some ideas!\n\nYour CV\nProjects (course projects (linked to your GitHub repo!), publications, conference talks, poster presentations)\nExtracurriculars\nAwards\nBlog\nMiscellaneous (hobbies)\n\nFeel free to get creative. This is just practice for website building - you can always come back and update your website later. Just remember, the website is PUBLIC. Do not put any information that you do not want shared on the internet.\n\n\nSave all files and click the Render button. Click through your website to ensure that everything is working!\n\n\nPush your Changes to Github\nEverything you’ve done so far only exists on your local machine.\nIn the terminal, do quarto render to re-render all documents. Save all.\nThen,sStage, commit, and push your changes (Steps 7 and 8 above). Test our your new website by visiting it using the GitHub link (see Step 8)."

    "section": "Getting Fancy",
    "text": "Getting Fancy\nHere are some ways you can elevate your website!\n\nAdding a Search Bar\n\nAdd search: true under your navbar in your _quarto.yml file\nExample:\nwebsite:\n  title: \"STAT545 @ UBC\"\n  navbar:\n    background: primary\n    search: true\n\n\n\nAdding Icons to Navigation Bar\nSometimes, we want to use an icon instead of a work. For example, I could change “Home” to a house icon using:\nwebsite:\n  title: \"STAT545 @ UBC\"\n  navbar:\n    background: primary\n    search: true\n    left:\n      - href: index.qmd\n        text: \" \"\n        icon: house-door-fill\nThis will remove the Home text and replace it with a home icon.\n\n\nAdding a Drop-down Menu\nSome websites (like our STAT545 website) have so many pages that we need to condense topics into our top navigation bar. This can be achieved with a drop-down menu. I’ll show an example of how I have a drop-down menu for the two STAT545 Syllabi (A and B).\nI like to organize the website so that anything in a drop-down menu is in its own folder. For example, I have a webpages folder that contains a file (or folder) for each item I want on my navigation bar. I have my two syllabi hosted in webpages/syllabus/syllabusA.qmd and webpages/syllabus/syllabusB.qmd.\nTo create a drop-down menu, we use sidebar: in the _quarto.yml document:\nwebsite:\n  title: \"STAT545 @ UBC\"\n  navbar:\n    background: primary\n    search: true\n    left:\n      - href: index.qmd\n        text: \" \"\n        icon: house-door-fill\n      - sidebar:syllabus\n-sidebar:syllabus tells Quarto that I am going to have subpages, and I reference them using the syllabus id. For example:\nwebsite:\n  title: \"STAT545 @ UBC\"\n  navbar:\n    background: primary\n    search: true\n    left:\n      - href: index.qmd\n        text: \" \"\n        icon: house-door-fill\n      - sidebar:syllabus\n        \n  sidebar:\n    - id: syllabus\n      title: \"Syllabus\"\n      style: \"docked\"\n      background: light\n      collapse-level: 2\n      contents: \n        - webpages/syllabus/syllabusA.qmd\n        - webpages/syllabus/syllabusB.qmd\nThis creates a section on my Navigation Bar called “Syllabus”, which drops down to contain syllabusA.qmd and syllabusB.qmd, which are regular pages like the courses.qmd that we created!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdd a GitHub Link on your Navigation Bar\nWe can add a right-hand link to GitHub with its own icon. This will appear beside the search icon. In the _quarto.yml, add a right: section linking to GitHub.\nwebsite:\n  title: \"STAT545 @ UBC\"\n  navbar:\n    background: primary\n    search: true\n    left:\n...\n...\n...\n        \n    right:\n      - href: \"https://github.com/UBC-STAT/STAT545.github.io\"\n        text: \"GitHub\"\n        icon: github\n\n\nAdd a Table of Contents on Each Page\nIf you have a lot of information on each page, adding a Table of Contents can be useful. In the _quarto.yml, add toc: true\nformat:\n  html:\n    theme:\n      - cosmo\n      - brand\n    css: styles.css\n    toc: true\n\n\nAdd a Favicon (Website Icon) and Logo\nFavicons are useful ways to brand your website. These are small icons that identify your website (think Facebook with their infamous blue “F”, or Google’s rainbow “F”) that appear in browser tabs such as Google Chrome and on web searches.\nIn the _quarto.yml file, we can include the following under website:\nwebsite:\n      favicon: &lt;favicon.png&gt;\nwhere &lt;favicon.png&gt; is the image (or path to the image, if its in a folder) that you’d like to use!\nYou can also add a logo that appears in the top lefthand corner of your website using the logo command, for example:\n navbar:\n    background: primary\n    search: true\n    logo: &lt;yourlogo&gt;.png\n\n\nExtras\nThere is SO much more that Quarto can do, and this is just scratching the surface. From aesthetics to website navigation, https://quarto.org/docs/websites/ has so many examples of cool things you can do with your website.\nIf you’d like to see how THIS exact website was built, check out https://github.com/UBC-STAT/STAT545.github.io."
