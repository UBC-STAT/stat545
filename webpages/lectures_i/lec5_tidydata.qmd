## Tidy Data and the Tidyverse

In the last two weeks, we learned about the `dplyr` package for data manipulation and the `ggplot2` package for graphing. These two packages are part of the “tidyverse”: a collection of data science packages that are designed to have input data frames and output data frames that are *tidy*. In fact, we can load all packages in the tidyverse at once with the single command `library(tidyverse)`.

Here, we are using the word “tidy” in a technical sense - we’re not talking about how “neat” or “organized” your data is. Instead, “tidy” is a very specific set of rules for storing data.

**Tidy data is defined as data where**

-   **each variables form a column,**

-   **each observation forms a row, and**

-   **each cell is a single measurement.** [@tidyR]

So why do we want to use it?

[![Artwork by Allison Horst (\@allisonhorst)](/webpages/slides/slidefiles/images/tidydata_3.jpg){fig-alt="When working with tidy data, we can use the same tools in similar ways for each data set. But working with untidy data often means reinventing the wheel with one-time approaches that are hard to iterate or reuse."}](https://github.com/allisonhorst/stats-illustrations/tree/main/rstats-artwork)

For example, the following data set containing cat and dog names by family is [not tidy.]{.underline} We have multiple observations per row (a cat, and a dog observation):

| Owner     | Pet 1                        | Pet 2           |
|-----------|------------------------------|-----------------|
| Asfar     | Cosmo (Orange Cat)           | Zuko (Grey Dog) |
| Grace     | Dorito (Brown Chipmunk)      |                 |
| Zifu      | Booger (Black and White Dog) |                 |
| Flora     | Mimi (White Cat)             |                 |
| Yvette    | Mia (Beige and White Cat)    |                 |
| Alexandra | Bambi (Black and White Dog)  |                 |

Instead, a tidy version of this data set may look like this:

| Pet Name  | Type     | Owner     | Colour          |
|-----------|----------|-----------|-----------------|
| Cosmo     | Cat      | Asfar     | Orange          |
| Zuko      | Dog      | Asfar     | Grey            |
| Dorito    | Chipmunk | Grace     | Brown           |
| Booger    | Dog      | Zifu      | Black and White |
| Mimi      | Cat      | Flora     | White           |
| Mia       | Cat      | Yvette    | Beige and White |
| Alexandra | Dog      | Alexandra | Black and White |

Each row is an observation, each variable is a column, and each cell is a single measurement. Our data is tidy!

All of the data we used before this week were already tidy. This made it easy to use the tidyverse packages `dplyr` and `ggplot2` to do what we needed to do. Oftentimes however, data is not collected in a tidy way. So, what happens do we do when we have untidy data? Let's explore it!

### Example: Drinks

The `fivethirtyeight` R package contains a dataset called `drinks`. This dataset was compiled as part of a [FiveThirtyEight article](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/dear-mona-followup-where-do-people-drink-the-most-beer-wine-and-spirits/) that explored (among other things) which countries consumes the most alcohol. Let's look at a subset of the data:

```{r, message = F, warning = F}

drinks_tbl1 <- as_tibble(drinks) %>% 
  select(-total_litres_of_pure_alcohol) #remove total liters variable

head(drinks_tbl1) #view the first few rows of the data

```

The following graphic was made from the `drinks` dataset.

![](../../images/drinks.png){width="600" fig-align="center"}

It’s clear from the definition that tidiness is an attribute of a dataset. But did you know that tidiness also depends on what you are planning to *do* with the data? That’s because what’s an observation and what’s a variable depends on the data analysis plan!

### Exercise 1

With a partner or a small group discuss the following questions think about if the data is tidy or untidy. If tidy, what would the `ggplot` code look like to reproduce this graph? If untidy, what would the tidy format look like? Sketch the first few rows of the data. Now, what would the `ggplot` code look like to reproduce this graph?

## Basic Pivoting

Once you have figured out what’s tidy for you, you may come to realize that your data is *not* tidy. As we have discussed, it will typically save you time and frustration to tidy it before moving on in your analysis.

Very often this will involve using “pivoting” type functions. For example, the `tidyr` package in the `tidyverse` has two main pivoting functions:

1.  `pivot_longer()` makes datasets *longer*: it moves some information in the columns into new rows, thereby *increasing* the number of *rows* of the dataset.

2.  `pivot_wider()` makes datasets *wider*: it moves some information in the rows into new columns, thereby *decreasing* the number of rows of the dataset.

### **Pivoting Wider**

Here is an example of (artificial) data that is currently in "long" format, looking grades before and after active learning was incorporated into their math and science lectures:

```{r}

grades_long <- tibble(
  student_id = c(1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2,2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3),
  time = c("Before", "After", "Before", "After", "Before", "After", "Before", "After", "Before", "After", "Before", "After"),
  subject = c("Math", "Math", "Science", "Science", "Math", "Math", "Science","Science",  "Math", "Math", "Science", "Science"),
  score = c(85, 86, 92, 92, 78, 82, 88, 89, 95, 94, 90, 90)
)

head(grades_long)
```

Sometimes, we require data involving time to have row for each observation, and one column for each time point (i.e., wide data). While this isn't our "standard" definition of tidy, sometimes this is what is required for *longitudinal data* (i.e., data involving measures repeated over time). Nevertheless, let's try to pivot this table!

We can solve this problem using `pivot_wider`, which needs three pieces of information.

-   What is a set of columns that uniquely identifies each observation? Put their names in the `id_cols` argument.

-   Where should the names for the new columns come from? Put the name of the column you want to take the new variable names from in the `names_from` argument.

-   What values should the new columns contain? Put the name of the columns you want to take the values from to `values_from` in the `values_from` argument.

Note that if you don’t specify an `id_cols` argument, `pivot_wider` will assume that you want it to be every column except those in `names_from` and `values_from`. Further, any columns not included in `id_cols`, `names_from`, and `values_from` (e.g., `ep_id`) will simply be dropped.

We can pivot the `grades_long` table wider so that we have a columns "Scores_Before" and "Scores_After" for each student_id and subject:

```{r}
grades_wide <- grades_long %>% #assign new variable
  pivot_wider(names_from = time, #get column names from time
              values_from = score, #fill in values from score
              names_prefix = "Scores_") #add "scores_" to new column names

head(grades_wide)
```

### **Pivoting Longer**

#### **The Basics: Column Names Contain Variable Values**

Here is a snippet of WHO data on the number of tuberculosis cases in different years in different countries.

```{r, echo  = F}
who_wide <- tibble(country = c("Afghanistan", "Brazil", "China"),
                  `1999` = c(745, 37737, 212258),
                  `2000` = c(2666, 80488, 213766))

who_wide
```

IIf we wanted to compare tuberculosis cases over time by country (e.g. by plotting the year on the x-axis and case count on the y-axis with a line for each country), then this format is not tidy. There should be one observation per unit within each population (country-years). In this case, we do not observe units within each country-year, so each observation is a country-year. The variables then fall into place: the country and year labels, and the case counts.

(Aside: if we had measured more data, then perhaps there would be more units within each population! Imagine if we had case-level information, like severity. Then we could view cases as observations within the country-year populations, and we would have variables like country, year, case ID, and severity.)

So the tidy format here puts the variables (the year, the country, and the case counts) on the columns. There are 6 rows, one for each unique country-year combination. In this example, the tidy format is *longer*. That means to produce it using `who_wide`, we need to lengthen it by moving some information in the column names (the info about the measurement year) into new rows.

We can solve this problem using `pivot_longer`, which needs three pieces of information.

-   Which are the columns that we want to expand into more rows? Put their names in the `cols` argument.

-   We want to save the information in the names of those columns as values in new column(s) of our dataset. What should we name these new column(s)? This is the `names_to` argument.

-   We also want to preserve the information in the *values* of those columns - so we should save them as values in a new column of our dataset. What should we name it? This is the `values_to` argument.

```{r}
who_long <- who_wide %>% pivot_longer(cols = c('1999', '2000'), #pivot these columns
                         names_to = "year", #new column name is year
                         values_to = "cases") #use cases as the values of the column

who_long
```

Now our data is tidy!

#### **Example: Column Names Contain Multiple Variable Values**

Here’s a more realistic (but still simplified) look at the WHO Tuberculosis data.

```{r}
who_demo <- who2 %>% 
  select(country, year, starts_with("sp")) %>%
  rename_with(function(x) 
    str_remove(x, pattern="sp_"), 
    starts_with("sp")) %>% 
  filter(year %in% c(1999, 2000)) %>% 
  filter(country %in% c("Afghanistan", "Brazil", "China"))

head(who_demo)
```

This time, cases are broken down by gender (`f/m`) and by age range (`014\1524\2534\3544\4554\5564\65`).

Suppose now that we are interested in comparing tuberculosis rates over time across (potentially) gender, age, and country. Then the most granular population we are trying to describe is a country, gender, age, and year combination, and like in the last example, we have no measured sub-units within that population, so an observation is a unique combination of country, gender, age, and year. (What a mouthful!)

Once we’ve sorted that out, the variables fall into place: country, year, gender, age range, and case count. Values for gender and age range are currently located in the column names of `who_demo`, and values for case count are currently spread across multiple columns. So to tidy `who_demo` up, we need to use `pivot_longer()` to move the info in the columns into new rows.

Conceptually, this is pretty similar to the last example: we want to use the information in `m_014`, `m_1524`, etc. to create new rows. So we should put those column names into the `cols` argument. But now, we want the information in their column names - the gender and age - to go into *two* new columns: gender and age. We can do this by specifying two column names in the `names_to` argument: `gender` and `age`.

But how is `pivot_longer()` to know which part of the column name `m_014` corresponds to the gender, and which part corresponds to the age? You need to tell it that the pieces of information are separated by the “\_” character using the `names_sep` argument.

Finally, we can specify the name of the new column we want the values in the `m_014`, `m_1524`, etc. columns to go into with the `values_to` argument.

```{r}
who_demo %>% pivot_longer(cols = !(country:year), # all columns aside from country to year
                          names_to = c("gender", "age"), #new columns named age and gender
                          names_sep = "_",#current gender and age are a single variable separated by _
                          values_to = "cases") #use the cases column for the values

```

#### **Example: Column Names Contain Variable Names And Values**

So far we have seen examples where the column names contain variable values. But what if they contain names AND values?

Let’s have a look at the `household` dataset (loaded with the `tidyr` package), which has the date of birth and names of two children in families. Let’s say that we wanted to investigate how children names relate to their date of birth.

```{r}
head(household)
```

We are trying to learn about the population from which these children belong; it is hard to say precisely what that is without having more information about how this data was collected, but it is likely something like “all children living in a particular place in a particular year”. The units in this population are children. So to tidy this data, we’d want “date of birth” and “name” to be two variables/columns associated with an observation/row (a child). We know we want to use `pivot_longer()`, because we want to make `household` longer by creating new variables. But wait! The names of the “date of birth”/“name” variables AND the values of the “child” variable are BOTH in the column names of `household`!

Inspecting [the documentation](https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/reference/pivot_longer.html) for `pivot_longer()` very carefully reveals that you can use a special specification of the `names_to` argument to resolve this problem.

```{r}
household %>% pivot_longer(cols = -family, # all columns except family
                           names_to = c(".value", "child"), #change column names, .value is a placeholder
                           names_sep = "_") # dob and child are currently separated by _ in one single variable

```

The special `".value"` specification says that we want to use the first component of the pivoted column name as a variable name, and make a new column with values coming from the second component of the pivoted column name. The second thing we pass into `names_to` names that new column.

This process is best described by [Figure 6.7 from R4DS](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/data-tidy#fig-pivot-names-and-values).

But wait! Row 4 is a bunch of NAs! Does that mean this data isn’t tidy??

The fact that there is an NA does not necessarily mean that this data is untidy. To be clear: for the purpose of the tidy data definition, an indicator for a missing value *is* a value.

Whether this data is untidy depends on the data context. Essentially, the question we should ask is: “Is row 4 an observation that we are missing information about? Or is it simply an artifact of our pivoting procedure?”

Suppose this study was designed to only sample families with two children. Then, row 4 could be a real observation that we are missing information about: family 2 should have only been included if they had two children. Perhaps this reflects family 2 filling out a survey that asks them the number of children (in which they listed 2), but then getting distracted and forgetting to fill out the information for their second child. In this case, our data is tidy, and the tidy data format is a real advantage: it reveals missing information in our data set that was not obvious from the original untidy format.

Now suppose this study just samples families at large. We know from experience about the world that some families have one children, some families have two, and some families have more. Then, it seems possible that row 4 is *not* a real observation: family 2 might just have a single child. In this case, we have a row for something that is not an observation, so we would like to tidy up by dropping it. We could actually have done this by altering our original `pivot_wider()` call as follows:

```{r}
household %>% pivot_longer(cols = -family, 
                           names_to = c(".value", "child"), 
                           names_sep = "_", 
                           values_drop_na = TRUE) #remove NAs
```

This discussion highlights the importance of knowing the context in which your data is collected for tidying (and for your analysis at large). Here and elsewhere, it really pays to be in close contact with the people who generated your data.

## Separating and Uniting

Sometimes data has multiple pieces of information stored in a single column. To separate them into two distinct columns, we can use the `separate()` function from the `tidyverse` (technically, a package within tidyverse called `tidyr`.

`separate():` separates information within a column. It involves three arguments:

-   `col`: specifies the column we want to separate

-   `into`: specifies the names of the new columns.

-   `sep`: specifies where we want to cut. The default is pretty clever - it separates at any non-alphanumeric value. (How this is accomplished involves *regular expressions*, which are very useful when working with character data. We will learn more about regular expressions in STAT 545B. )

Conversely, `unite()` combines information from two or more columns into one. Involves:

-   `col`: name of the new column

-   `...`: the names of columns to be united

-   `sep`: specifies the separator to use between values (i.e., "-")

```{r}
table3 <- tibble(country = c("Afghanistan", "Afghanistan", "Brazil", "Brazil", "China", "China"),
                 year = c(1999, 2000, 1999, 2000, 1999, 2000),
                 rate = c("745/19987071", "2666/20595360", "37737/172006362", 
                          "80488/174504898", "212258/1272915272", "213766/1280428583"))

table3
```

The `rate` column contains the values of two variables: case counts and population counts. We would like to snip it apart at the “/” character to create two columns:

```{r}
table5 <- table3 %>% separate(col = rate, 
                    into = c("cases", "population"))
table5
```

The `col` argument specifies the column we want to separate, and the `into` argument specifies the names of the new columns. The `sep` argument (not specified here) specifies where we want to cut. The default is pretty clever - it separates at any non-alphanumeric value. (How this is accomplished involves *regular expressions*, which are very useful when working with character data. We will learn more about regular expressions in STAT 545B. )

## The Merits of Untidy Data

As we’ve seen, tidy data is often very helpful. But there are also times when *un*tidy data is good. Here are a few reasons:

-   The format that lends itself best to fast computations might not be tidy. [Case Study: Tidy Genomics](http://varianceexplained.org/r/tidy-genomics/).

-   Untidy data is often easier for humans to interpret and edit. See [Untidy Data: The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Tables](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.15005.pdf).

-   We could lose important information about the context in which the data was collected by cleaning and tidying raw data. This can have important ethical implications; see Chapter 5 of the book [“Data Feminism”](https://data-feminism.mitpress.mit.edu/) by Catherine D’Ignazio and Lauren F. Klein.

In summary, tidiness is a very useful concept, and tidying data is often useful. But we should remember that absolutes are few and far between in data science and statistics. Just because tidying data is *often* useful, doesn’t mean it’s *always* useful.
