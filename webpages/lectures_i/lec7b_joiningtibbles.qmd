From today’s class, students are anticipated to be able to:

-   Recognize how to manipulate data through a variety of tibble joins such as:

    -   Mutating joins: `left_join()`, `right_join()`, `full_join()`, `anti_join()`

    -   Filtering joins: `semi_join()`, `anti_join()`

-   Perform binding: `bind_rows()`, `bind_cols()`

-   Join more than 2 tibbles

-   Join based on multiple conditions

-   Perform set operations on data: `intersect()`, `union()`, `setdiff()`

-   Join tibbles with different types of variables

## Set-up

We will require the `tidyverse` functions for this chapter:

```{r, message = F, warning = F}
# install.packages("tidyverse")
library(tidyverse)
```


## Overview of join functions

**Note:** In order to merge two tibbles, you need to have an identifier variable that has unique values for every row of observations in both tibbles.

Create two sample tibbles:

```{r}
# First tibble
df1 <- tibble(ID = 1:3,                     
              Name = c("Sophie", "Josh","Alex"))

# Second tibble
df2 <- tibble(ID = 2:4,                      
              Age = c(20,50,31))
```

## Mutating joins

### **Join matching rows from `df2` to `df1`**

![](../../images/tablejoins/left_join.png){width=400 fig-align="center"}

```{r}
left_join(df1, df2, by = "ID")
```

### **Join matching rows from `df1` to `df2`**

![](../../images/tablejoins/right_join.png){width=400 fig-align="center"}


```{r}
right_join(df1, df2, by = "ID")
```

### **Retain only rows present in both sets**

![](../../images/tablejoins/inner_join.png){width=400 fig-align="center"}


```{r}
inner_join(df1, df2, by = "ID")
```

### **Retain all values, all rows**

![](../../images/tablejoins/full_join.png){width=360 fig-align="center"}


```{r}
full_join(df1, df2, by = "ID")
```

## Filtering joins

### **Retain all rows in `df1` that have a match in `df2`**

![](../../images/tablejoins/semi_join.png){width=400 fig-align="center"}

```{r}
semi_join(df1, df2, by = "ID")
```

### **Retain all rows in `df1` that do not have a match in `df2`**

![](../../images/tablejoins/anti_join.png){width=400 fig-align="center"}

```{r}
anti_join(df1, df2, by = "ID")
```

## Binding

### **Append `df2` to `df1` as new rows**

![](../../images/tablejoins/bind_rows.png){width=400 fig-align="center"}

```{r}
bind_rows(df1, df2)
```

### **Append `df2` to `df1` as new columns**

![](../../images/tablejoins/bind_cols.png){width=400 fig-align="center"}

```{r}
bind_cols(df1, df2)
```

## Joining multiple (\>2) tibbles

Create a third tibble

```{r}
df3 <- tibble(ID = 1:5,                      
              Height = c(175,167,190,155,160))
```

![](../../images/tablejoins/three_tibbles.png){width=600 fig-align="center"}

Use piping operator (%\>%) to layer multiple join functions

```{r}
full_join(df1, df2, by = "ID") %>%
  full_join(df3, by = "ID") 
```

## Joining tibbles on multiple conditions

![](../../images/tablejoins/multiple_conditions.png){width=400 fig-align="center"}

Create two new tibbles `df4` and `df5`

```{r}
df4 <- tibble(FirstName = c("Sophie", "Josh","Alex"),
              LastName=c("Wang","Smith","Smith"),
              Age = c(42,20,50))

df5 <- tibble(First_name = c("Josh","Alex","Sophie"),        
              Last_name=c("Smith","Smith","Jones"),
              Height = c(167,190,155))
```

![](../../images/tablejoins/multiple_conditions_full.png){width=400 fig-align="center"}

```{r}
full_join(df4, df5, by = c("FirstName" = "First_name", "LastName" = "Last_name"))
```

## Set operations

Create sample tibbles

![](../../images/tablejoins/df6df7.png){width=400 fig-align="center"}

```{r}
# First tibble
df6 <- tibble(Number = 1:3,                     
              Letter = c("A", "B","C"))

# Second tibble
df7 <- tibble(Number = 2:4,                      
              Letter = c("B","C","D"))
```

### **Include rows that appear in both tibbles**

![](../../images/tablejoins/intersect.png){width=400 fig-align="center"}

```{r}
# First tibble
df6 <- tibble(Number = 1:3,                     
              Letter = c("A", "B","C"))

# Second tibble
df7 <- tibble(Number = 2:4,                      
              Letter = c("B","C","D"))
```

### **Include rows that appear in either or both tibbles**

![](../../images/tablejoins/union.png){width=400 fig-align="center"}

```{r}
union(df6, df7)
```

### **Include rows that appear in one tibble/dataset but not another**

![](../../images/tablejoins/setdiff.png){width=400 fig-align="center"}

Include rows that appear in `df6` but not in `df7`

```{r}
setdiff(df6, df7)
```

Include rows that appear in `df7` but not in `df6`

```{r}
setdiff(df7, df6)
```

## Joining tibbles with different types of variables

You can also join tibbles with sets of predictions:

```{r}
set.seed(1) #make reproducible

x <- rnorm(5) #randomly sample 5 times from a N(0,1) distribution

model1 <- tibble(x = x, yhat = 2.1 + 3.2 * x) #do prediction based on the linear function
model2 <- tibble(x = x, yhat = 1.5 + 2.9 * x)

left_join(model1, model2, by = "x")

```

## Worksheet A5

Try your hand at basics of tibble joins by working through the corresponding part of Worksheet A5.

There will be some class time to go over solutions if you got stuck on any questions.
