title: "Mini Data Analysis: Deliverable 1"

## Deliverable 1 will be due on Friday October 3rd, 2025 at 11:59pm PT.

This project includes two deliverables, each with explicit tasks. Tasks that are more challenging will often be allocated more points.

Each deliverable will be also graded for reproducibility, cleanliness, and coherence of the overall Github submission. While the two deliverables will be submitted as independent assessments, the analysis itself is a continuum - think of it as two chapters to a story. Each chapter, or in this case, portion of your analysis, should be easily followed through by someone unfamiliar with the content. [Here](https://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-inflammation/06-best-practices-R.html) is a good resource for what constitutes "good code". Learning good coding practices early in your career will save you hassle later on!

# Learning Objectives

By the end of this deliverable, you should:

-   Become familiar with your dataset of choosing

-   Select 4 questions that you would like to answer with your data

-   Generate a reproducible and clear report using R Markdown

-   Become familiar with manipulating and summarizing your data in tibbles using `dplyr`, with a research question in mind.

# Instructions

### Download Datasets

1.  In RStudio, install the [`datateachr`](https://github.com/UBC-MDS/datateachr) package by typing the following into your **R terminal**:

```         
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("UBC-MDS/datateachr")
```

2.  Load the packages below.

```{r, eval = F}
library(datateachr)
library(tidyverse)
```

3.  Make a repository in our GitHub classroom. You can do this by following the steps found on canvas in the entry called [MDA: Create a repository](https://canvas.ubc.ca/courses/169555/pages/mda-create-a-repository). One completed, your repository should automatically be listed as part of the stat545ubc-2025 Organization.

### Download RMarkdown Report

**To complete this deliverable**, download and edit the [mini-project-1.Rmd](https://github.com/UBC-STAT/STAT545.github.io/blob/main/content/mini-data-analysis/mini-project-1.Rmd) directly. Follow the instructions given in the .Rmd file. Fill in the sections that are tagged with `<!--- start your work below --->`.

**To submit this deliverable**, make sure to knit this `.Rmd` file to an `.md` file by changing the YAML output settings from `output: html_document` to `output: github_document`. Commit and push all of your work to the mini-analysis GitHub repository you made earlier, and tag a release on GitHub. Then, submit a link to your tagged release on canvas.

**Points**: This deliverable is worth 36 points: 30 for your analysis, and 6 for overall reproducibility, cleanliness, and coherence of the Github submission.
