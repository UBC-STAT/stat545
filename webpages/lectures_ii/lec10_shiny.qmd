This topic aims to provide you with a foundation for making a shiny app. From this topic, students are anticipated to be able to:

-   develop the user interface of a shiny app from scratch,

-   develop interactivity using widgets in a shiny app,

-   deploy a shiny app to shinyapps.io,

-   create interactive Shiny R Markdown documents (embed shiny features within an Rmd file).

And possibly:

-   Make an interactive plot with plotly

-   Make an interactive data table with the `DT` package

We will spend two classes creating a Shiny dashboard together.

## Why Dashboards?

Dashboards allow users to get real time (and often customizable) overviews of information. Dashboards can be used for monitoring, measuring, analyzing, and presenting data.

## R Shiny

Shiny is an open-source R package that allows users to create interactive web applications directly from R without needing to learn traditional web development languages like HTML, CSS, or JavaScript.

Here are some examples of R Shiny Dashboards:

Today, we'll be replicating this dashboard to explore BS Liquor Store prices, from Dean Attali:

To use Shiny, install it in your R Console with `install.packages("shiny")`.

### Initialize the Shiny App

There are three basic components to a Shiny app:

-   the user interface (UI) (the appearance of the app)

-   a server (which does the app's computations)

-   the app (assembles the app combining the UI and the server)

A basic Shiny app may take the following form:

``` r
library(shiny)

ui <- fluidPage()

server <- function(input, output) {
  
}


shinyApp(ui = ui, server = server) #do not include code past this point
```

To generate a Shiny App, you can either go to "File" \> "New File" \> "Shiny Web App" in RStudio which will generate a template for you with a working example, or you can save the above code in a single file called "app.R".

If you generated the template using R Studio, the following code will appear:

``` r

library(shiny)

# Define UI for application that draws a histogram
ui <- fluidPage(

    # Application title
    titlePanel("Old Faithful Geyser Data"),

    # Sidebar with a slider input for number of bins 
    sidebarLayout(
        sidebarPanel(
            sliderInput("bins",
                        "Number of bins:",
                        min = 1,
                        max = 50,
                        value = 30)
        ),

        # Show a plot of the generated distribution
        mainPanel(
           plotOutput("distPlot")
        )
    )
)

# Define server logic required to draw a histogram
server <- function(input, output) {

    output$distPlot <- renderPlot({
        # generate bins based on input$bins from ui.R
        x    <- faithful[, 2]
        bins <- seq(min(x), max(x), length.out = input$bins + 1)

        # draw the histogram with the specified number of bins
        hist(x, breaks = bins, col = 'darkgray', border = 'white',
             xlab = 'Waiting time to next eruption (in mins)',
             main = 'Histogram of waiting times')
    })
}

# Run the application 
shinyApp(ui = ui, server = server)
```

You can click the "Run App" button to explore the demo. We see that there is a slider which the user can manipulate which changes the number of bins used to produce a histogram, which is updated live!

For example, if you set the number of bins to 8, you will see:

![](images/shiny1.png){fig-alt="Shiny App demonstrating a histogram with 8 bins"}

Or you can slide the number of bins to 30 and you should see:

![](images/shiny2.png){fig-alt="Shiny Demo where slider indicating number of bins is increased to 30"}

We will go through the basics of this demo app, and then build another from scratch.

::: callout-note
For more complex apps, you can save the UI and server separately so long as they exist in the same directory. [More info here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1dXhqqsD7dPOOdcC5Y7RW--dEU7UfU52qlb0YD3kKeLw/edit?slide=id.gd565d6fc7_0_192#slide=id.gd565d6fc7_0_192).

### Build the UI

Inside of the `fluidPage()` function, you can define and format different elements that will be used to build your Shiny app. For example, in the pre-generated example provided by R Studio, we have the following:

``` r
# Define UI for application that draws a histogram
ui <- fluidPage(

    # Application title
    titlePanel("Old Faithful Geyser Data"),

    # Sidebar with a slider input for number of bins 
    sidebarLayout(
        sidebarPanel(
            sliderInput("bins",
                        "Number of bins:",
                        min = 1,
                        max = 50,
                        value = 30)
        ),

        # Show a plot of the generated distribution
        mainPanel(
           plotOutput("distPlot")
        )
    )
)
```

We see that within the `fluidPage()` function, we've defined a title and a sidebar with a slider that the user can manipulate the change around the number of bins in the histogram we wish to generate (this is an **input** that we will use to produce a plot). In the main panel (the main part of the app where the plot is shown in the images above), we are going to **output** a plot, which we will define in the `server()` function later. Here, we are just telling Shiny what goes where, but not calculating anything. There are more options for the UI that we will explore in our demo later.

### Build the Server

As stated previously, we've set up the UI of the app but we haven't really calculated anything. Recall the code from the R Studio template:

``` r
# Define server logic required to draw a histogram
server <- function(input, output) {

    output$distPlot <- renderPlot({
        # generate bins based on input$bins from ui.R
        x    <- faithful[, 2]
        bins <- seq(min(x), max(x), length.out = input$bins + 1)

        # draw the histogram with the specified number of bins
        hist(x, breaks = bins, col = 'darkgray', border = 'white',
             xlab = 'Waiting time to next eruption (in mins)',
             main = 'Histogram of waiting times')
    })
}
```

We have a function that takes some **input** (in our case, the number of bins the user chose via the slider), and it **outputs** a histogram using the selected number of bins. Here, `hist()` is generating a histogram - the default is just not using `ggplot2` like we've used before in this class.

### Generate the App

The final part of the code is

``` r
# Run the application 
shinyApp(ui = ui, server = server)
```

which combines everything together and allows you to interact with the app!

## Demo: BC Liquor Store Prices

We will now follow along with [this tutorial by Dean Attali](https://deanattali.com/blog/building-shiny-apps-tutorial/) that creates a dashboard exploring alcohol prices and alcohol content. We will be slowly building this app from scratch to get a better sense of Shiny.
