From this topic, students are anticipated to be able to build a basic R package, especially using the `devtools` package.

-   Write a DESCRIPTION file

-   Carefully curate package dependencies

-   Document functions and data using `roxygen2` comments and tags

-   Include tests with testthat in accordance with the R package infrastructure.

-   Add a license

-   Update an R package via semantic version-ing, NEWS, changelog.

-   Develop and build informative vignettes and a package README.

## Why R Packages?

As mentioned in the “functions” topic, your analysis will probably benefit from homemade functions: making functions forces you to think about your analysis in terms of its key computational parts, and makes for robust and readable code. Here are a few benefits that result by bundling these functions into an R package:

-   Organized documentation

-   Sharability

-   Built-in checks to ensure your package is working

-   Templates for organizing your work

-   Ability to attach data sets to share

The alternative is keeping the functions stored in separate files, and `source()`ing them into your analysis scripts, but this can become unwieldy. Plus, if your package becomes *really* nice, you might want to share it with the world!

We've been using various packages all semester, including `dplyr`. You can actually see the underlying package which is hosted on (pretends to be shocked) GitHub: https://github.com/tidyverse/dplyr.

For this topic, we’ll be making an R package like the toy [square package](https://github.com/lucylgao/square), by following along with [“The Whole Game” Chapter of “R packages”](https://r-pkgs.org/whole-game.html).

::: callout-tip
Many of the functions we call are from the `devtools` package in R. If you're getting errors when trying to run some commands, try reloading `devtools` in the Console by running `library(devtools)`.
:::

## Minimal Working Example

First, make a minimal viable product:

-   In any R console, install (if necessary) and load the `devtools` package in the console (do this every time you go to work on your package).

    -   You will create a new R Project in the next step, so don't worry about the location now.

-   Run `create_package()` in the console (NOTE: all `devtools` functions should be written in the console).

    -   (this chooses better defaults than going through the File menu).
    -   Set the file path to be wherever you'd like the package to live. I'll be saving it on my desktop in a (not yet created) folder called "powers" by calling `create_package("~/Desktop/powers")`
    -   Allow access if a pop-up appears, and RStudio will refresh to your new Project.
    -   If you look at the new folder that was created (mine is on my desktop), you'll see an R Project, a DESCRIPTION file, a NAMESPACE file, and an R folder where all of your functions will be.

-   Create a simple function in a .R file, and *save it in the R folder*

    -   you can do this by navigating to the R folder on the right hand pane of your R Project under "Files", opening the R folder, and selecting "New File" \> "R Script"

        ![](../../images/addRfile.png){fig-align="center" width="400"}

    -   Name the file "square.R". We will be adding a simple function to file with an `#' @export` command to ensure it works properly with our package

        ```{r}
        #' @export
        square <- function(x){
          x^2
        }
        ```

-   In the console, reload `devtools` and run the `document()` function.

    -   Any function with the `#' @export` tag will be exported to the namespace file which contains a list of functions we want to make available in the R package.

-   Run `use_git()` to start using version control and hosting your package on Github:

    -   Prefer to start your project on GitHub? Or locally? Either way, useful instructions for what to do can be found [in “Happy Git with R” Part III](#0).

-   Run `load_all()` in the console to test your package out

    -   If R Restarted, then you need to reload `devtools` before running `load_all()`.

    -   see if `square(5)` returns the correct answer

-   Check that the package is intact: run `check()` in the Console

-   Edit the DESCRIPTION file

    -   First, run `use_mit_license("Your Name")` in the Console.

    -   Open the DESCRIPTION file and edit the Author information and Package Title.

        ``` r
        Package: powers
        Title: Easy computation of powers
        Version: 0.0.0.9000
        Authors@R: 
            person("YOUR FIRST NAME", "YOUR LAST NAME", , "YOUR EMAIL", role = c("aut", "cre"))
        Description: Calculates various powers of numeric data (squares, cubics, etc)
        License: MIT + file LICENSE
        Encoding: UTF-8
        Roxygen: list(markdown = TRUE)
        RoxygenNote: 7.3.2
        Suggests: 
            testthat (>= 3.0.0)
        Config/testthat/edition: 3
        ```

-   Add a README file

    -   Run `use_readme_rmd()` in the Console.

    -   Open the RMD file and add some information for the package.

        ```` Markdown

        output: github_document
        ---

        <!-- README.md is generated from README.Rmd. Please edit that file -->

        ```{r, include = FALSE}
        knitr::opts_chunk$set(
          collapse = TRUE,
          comment = "#>",
          fig.path = "man/figures/README-",
          out.width = "100%"
        )
        ```

        # powers Package

        This is a minimal working example of my first R Package for STAT545!

        ## Installation

        Package installation can be done directly by calling
        `devtools::install_github("YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/powers")`

        ## Example

        This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

        ```{r example}
        library(powers)
        square(c(2,4,5))
        ```
        ````

    -   Render the README every time with `build_readme()`.

-   Document the function:

    -   Navigate back to the function `square` we made and click anywhere inside of the function. Select “Code" \> "Insert roxygen skeleton”

    -   Edit the documentation for `param`, `returns`, and `examples`. You can also add a `@title` and `@description`. Here's what mine looks like:

        ```{r}

        #' @title Square a single value or vector
        #' @description
        #' Squares a single numeric value or a numeric vector
        #'
        #' @param x, numeric
        #'
        #' @returns numeric, vector
        #'
        #' @examples
        #' square(5)
        #' square(c(4, 5, 6))
        #' @export
        square <- function(x){
          x^2
        }
        ```

    -   Run `document()` again in the Console.

    -   Run `check()` again to make sure your examples are working.

-   Install and Restart (`Ctrl + Shift + B` (Windows & Linux) or `Cmd + Shift + B` (macOS)) , or run `install()` in the console. Try loading the package and using it!

## Expand Your Package

Now, let's expand the R package that we just created:

1.  Run `use_testthat()` in the Console (re-load `devtools` if R recently restarted)

    -   This will create a folder called `tests` and a `testthat.R` file which we will add our tests to.

    -   Run `use_test("square")` in the Console. This will create a file called test-square.R

    -   Update it to include the following tests (and save the file!):

        ``` r
        test_that("square works", {
          expect_equal(square(3), 9)
          expect_equal(square(0), 0)
          expect_equal(square(c(2,4)), c(4,16))
          expect_equal(square(c(3, NA)), c(9, NA))
        })
        ```

    -   Check all tests with `test()` in the Console. This also happens with `check()`.

2.  We don’t really need to use functions from another package here, but practice declaring your general intention to use some functions from the dplyr namespace by running `use_package("dplyr")` in the Console only once. Now your package will be able to use the `dplyr` package functions.

3.  Connect your local package to Github with `use_github()`. Say yes to committing and publishing the changes. Now your package should be on GitHub!

4.  Make a vignette, a long-form document that serves as a detailed guide or tutorial for an R package:

    -   `use_vignette("powers")`

    -   `build_vignettes()`.

5.  Include data with the R package with `use_data(R_OBJECT_HERE)`. Then document *a string of its name* in a new R script using [a different collection of roxygen tags](https://r-pkgs.org/data.html#documenting-data).

    -   I'll add the `mtcars` dataset using `use_data(mtcars)`

6.  Release your package:

    -   Make a NEWS.md file with `use_news_md()` and add the main development notes.

    -   Commit changes (in Terminal on RStudio)

        -   `git add .`

        -   `git commit -m "Adding Vignette:"`

    -   Push Changes (in Terminal on RStudio)

        -   `git push origin main`

        -   (If you get an error, try going to the Git section in the top right hand pane and push from there)

    -   Tag a release on GitHub.

        -   Recall *How to tag a release* from the Collaborative Project Milestone 1:

            1.  Navigate to the main page (root) of your GitHub repository.

            2.  There should be a small link on the right-hand-side of your page that says “Create a new release”. Click that.

            3.  For the tag version/name, put `1.0.0`

            4.  Choose a release title and description (this is less important).

            5.  Do **not** check off “This is a pre-release”.

            6.  Click “Publish Release”.

### Exercise

Try installing the package that the person beside you just created. Restart RStudio, load `devtools` and see if you can use `devtools::install_github("YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/powers")` to install their package. Load in the newly installed `powers` package and test out the `square` function and see if it works!
